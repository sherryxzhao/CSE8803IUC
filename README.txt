Leverage NLP and Data Analysis on Public Tweet Sentiment and Crime Data is a Python-based project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze the sentiment of public tweets and the crime data in Los Angeles and Boston.

To duplicate the project, you need to install Python 3.9 or higher and Jupyter Notebook. Once these dependencies are installed, you can download or clone the project's source code from the GitHub repository. 

The project consists of several Python scripts that perform different functions, such as data collection, data cleaning, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and ML model training. To use the package, you can run the corresponding Jupyter Notebook file that contains the entire workflow. The notebook uses Pandas, Numpy, tweetnlp, snscrape, and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization. In the Github repository, the data_collection folder has all the Jupyter notebooks used for collecting and cleaning the crime data and public tweets. The data folder has all the cleaned data in csv format including the ground truth labels and features used in Machine Learning models. The models folder has all the Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluating the various models.

Before running the model notebooks, you need to collect public tweets using snscrape and crime data from the respective cities. Once the data is collected, you can proceed with data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as removing invalid data points, transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis, and running topic modeling on the tweets. The sentiment analysis is performed on the tweets using the inferred topics. All the above steps are accomplished by running the Jupyter notebooks in the data_collection folder. The output of each step is included in the data folder.

The ML models are trained on the cleaned data to predict crime rates in the respective cities. The notebook provides different options for training and testing the ML models, such as using different algorithms, feature selection techniques, and evaluation metrics included in the models folder.
