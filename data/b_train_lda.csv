2022-02-01,"It was great to connect with my host @imAbhishek_USA in Boston. Coming from Amethi, Abhishek has worked hard to represent the issues of indian diaspora in the region. 

Last week, It was a proud moment to celebrate Republic Day of india with senior American political figures https://t.co/0SZV0ziMc5 Let’s do that hockey! #NHLBruins #SeaKraken https://t.co/qIzTi2jJBF The grant balance after paying for single cell experiments #AcademicChatter https://t.co/EyG2QsmS8L What’s a biological or computational tool / technology you think is really cool [in theory] because you don’t fully understand it yet or haven’t had time to learn?

Discussion currently happening in @DnaDeviants slack: https://t.co/HCVm7Uwqc3

🧬😎 no judgment zone! #scicomm Pregaming at The Harp to meet you @lalalalaurrrren! #NHLBruins https://t.co/EUVBb29v28 I caught them this AM .@pictureboston https://t.co/pNfgWRlI6C Fact: When I’m not coding or studying or playing FIFA. I teach♟ 📚 

Also Fact: I’ll be live in less than an hour for some important rivals grind tryna get that SR up. Next target ~ 2150. That should secure a spot in qualifiers. 

#FIFA22 | #NERevs https://t.co/DDIoiiIT4J Update: low key feel like I live here now but hooray for a healthy small bowel and for not crying in front of the entire radiology department 😷🥳 https://t.co/EOagP1Tjqu Harvard wins 4-1

They will play the winner of BC vs NU next Tuesday https://t.co/XYRprJXfDT I’ve never been more proud of Brian Flores than now whats on your plate? https://t.co/Ul9k5UGW6O I stand with Brian Flores! 🙏🏻 The NFL paints its phrase “End Racism” during the 2021 season and puts “Black Lives Matter” slogans during the 2020 season 
Meanwhile, the league has had a withstanding racist hiring practice when it comes to hiring black head coaches who are qualified for the job.
How sway? #NFL one on the board for each at the end of the second period! https://t.co/Eycjw6SKcF We gotta do something about the people who got a vehicle too big for their ""off-street"" parking spot and make up the space with the sidewalk Woke America should go back to sleep. Sleep is important for cognitive function. Test your ability to plan nonsensical two-transfer trips like a New Yorker navigating around a delay! 🤓 Every month @whoismarypalmer  sponsors a Cannabis brunch .... #IYKYK #marypalmer #CannabisCommunity https://t.co/HrdrzQGAen @ViatorLion10 @BleacherReport According to the lawsuit he was paid to lose. Also been stated he wanted Herbert and then Watson. Brian Flores wants to win. going to work on my camera settings for the second period, but here some shots from the first! 

BU is tied with Harvard at 0 at the end of one! https://t.co/3PWUCMHBoE Thank you @AyannaPressley.  We collectively condemn the attacks on @MayorWu. The toxicity &amp; racism leveled against her have been unacceptable &amp; not OK.  #mapoli #bospoli The NFL is going to be in hot water for this. I legit knew there’s always been something foul about the hiring process regarding the lack of black head coaches in the NFL in recent years and why that was the case going to my first #seakraken tonight #krakhead https://t.co/XRy2USPS07 Great snow bank protected bike lane down Tremont St. 

Thanks @BostonPWD! ❄️ 🚲 https://t.co/oL6lWYInWh Manifesting some good luck for experiments this lunar new year …

Jackpot! https://t.co/BdB2Kn4hUg howdy 👋🏼 https://t.co/YGLbKLQFMV UPDATE: Adopted! little idiot grill Good to see. Now go get some work done fellas. Scandal!! In all those cases *white men w/o a college degree* are behaving such a way, and we treat it as economic, not racial. Just one of the ways we treat whiteness as default and invisible. Which is a conversation we could have and learn from. If the right weren't trying to ban it. 6/6 We put OL in the league! @Coach_Applebaum a hell of a teacher, proofs in the pudding! #GetIn Similarly media reports almost offhandedly say things like ""working class anger at CRT"" or the ""working class popularity of Joe Rogan"" or of course ""working class voters turned out for Trump."" Precisely none of those statements are true. 5/n An obvious example of this is the way we discuss political polarization. The degree to which the media ignores that  the GOP is the party of white men and their wives and the Dems are the party of everyone else would be funny if it wasn't actively jeopardizing the Republic 4/n i never was like good at cooking because i just did not care but like 4 months ago i was like ok ur 26 grow up stupid and now i can cook and it kind of rules👍🏼 im grilling again rn btw 3 weeks ago I texted @mboyle1959 an expense question for @triplefknox and he said, ""Spend your money on a plane ticket to come see me instead.""

Welp, here we are! 4 hours in &amp; it's already been revolutionary for us &amp; how we're going to run Knoxville's premier training facility. https://t.co/cgWoKQEuYf Happy Rare Disease Day!
#rarediseasedsay
#RareDiseaseMonth So yesterday I tweeted about this misuse of the term working class. Most people understood what I meant. Some people chose to respond in bad faith. Those people are welcome to go straight to Hell. But some people legitimately didn't understand and for them, a thread. 1/n We're open! Whose thirsty? Come see us at 1172 Cambridge St, Cambridge MA.

Should Patriots fans who are upset @TomBrady spurned them in his retirement announcement really be mad at Tom, or should they be mad at Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft? 

They are the reasons he did not retire a Patriot.

Looks like Steven Fogarty in again tonight between Blidh and Lazar Linus Ullmark to start tonight vs Seattle, per Bruce Cassidy. He said he wanted to get him back in net after a tough loss in Dallas that wasn't his fault #TomBrady omitting the #ForeverNE organization and fans in his retirement post stings.

January is a tough month. February, too. I’m not the model but happy to share insight. 🤷‍♀️ tom brady personally thank me now or im tweeting about your chin implant again Scorci d'Italia. Sights of #Italy 🇮🇹 https://t.co/1DD7ytIO95 This is why @TomBrady didn’t thank the #patriots owner - GM - fans in his retirement post this morning #brady @Patriots #ForeverNE  He will be saving something special for #NewEngland https://t.co/ExafHofIeO Please help spread the word! 22 years of running the league and that's how you go out? Someone in your camp leaks it to Schefty and then complain how it ruined your vacation?

Then go to IG with some baby-shit soft teenage girl ass post to close out your career?

At 9:30am on a Tuesday? 1 month https://t.co/kAFJ1PinMF 💜💖💛 happy love month 💘🤍❤️ You do you https://t.co/EcKjrhDRgg Hungry dogs run faster @LouMerloni I think because he already said goodbye to New England before? Maybe I am wrong but that’s how I read it! Tom Brady does not make one mention about the fans of New England, the #ForeverNE, Coach Bill Belichick, or even thank the Kraft family in his retirement post on Instagram. 
Disappointed and stunned doesn’t even begin to describe the feeling I have Brady played for the @Patriots, right? Tom Brady has officially announced his retirement from the NFL. There will never be another player like him. Thanks for 22 unforgettable years and for changing football in New England. 

#NFL | #TB12 https://t.co/uMQeJTVaXS It was a pleasure working with you! You have a great future ahead of you! Hope we can work together in the future again!

This place feels like home more than anywhere else. This makes sense.

Inflation is something where it's obviously coming out of policy.

If your wages go up, or you get a job, you're going to be very aware of how your own efforts led to that, and you won't be thinking about a counterfactual policy environment. This afternoon, I testified to the Revenue Committee in support of H.4282, #CambMa’s home rule petition for a real estate transfer fee. This will allow our city to retain a tiny fraction of the wealth being generated by the real estate market to fund our affordable housing trust. https://t.co/2QzCag1ArK And just like that…organic electronics make their way into @MIT, @mitmrl and @mit_dmse!

Nolan Ryan’s 7 career no hitters it tracks! Been at Starbucks since 2017 using it as a stepping stool towards achieving my dreams of being a full-time creative, but I realized that in order to open new doors I had to close some pre-existing ones.

Super fun getting searched at the airport and finding out after a thorough examination of everything in my suitcase (with which I recently traveled internationally) that the “suspicious” object was an old classic iPod that was in a pocket I apparently haven’t opened in years. Sen. Manchin's #DirtyDeal would gut bedrock environmental protections that we rely on to protect our health, communities, and environment. Hold the line and vote no. @SenWarren @SenMarkey https://t.co/ooWJ2sNgqJ Invited @DavidVermette to class today, where he talked about the cold reality of the past in 1920s New England to my students - the rise of the KKK in places like Maine and Franco-American experience as it came face to face with these horrors.

A report has been drafted, but members are now arguing over how one-sided and petty it should be, with most members opting for ""very"". 

A thread🧵 Your neighborhood association takes a vote on what development projects to support? Any only residents who show up to the meeting get to vote? That's cute. Friendship and chosen family is so important to me. I would be absolutely devastated if someone I love betrayed me in this manner. I’ve cut people off for homophobia and will absolutely protect my peace when necessary Before I embraced the totality of my greatness I would settle on being someone’s “exception” 

“David, I don’t really fuck with gay people like that but you’re cool”

Society will lead us to believe that is compromise and a good-faith attempt at community, it’s not don’t we fuckin know it It does, and it’s consistent with the cool idea suggested by my colleague Matt Stephenson  (and others): giving a majority of senators (if representing a majority of the nation) the power to end debate.

Since we’ve been fighting for a transformative bill for 2 years, we’ve got a readymade list of things to keep fighting for from the exec branch, at the state level, or even in congress if we win in nov. if reducing emissions is your top priority, you’re right to be happy.

Thankful that I was able to do a staple option for my thesis that helped me get all these manuscripts close to submission quality 😅 Finalizing all of your PhD work/papers is one of the most important things you can do to best position yourself for starting a postdoc. 

I received this sage advice from multiple people but am unfortunately still editing all of my manuscripts while working on postdoc projects 😰 Fascinating episode. Sexual behaviors that are considered abhorrent in WEIRD cultures are not just normal, but required, in others.

No thanks to despicable Turtle Swamp's landlord dropping their lawsuit against the Pine St Inn development and instead turning nextdoor WITH Turtle Swamp to sue the senior housing development 🤢 Arguments for neutrality may have had a place or may one day have a place - though I doubt it - but that place assuredly isn't the here and now. 

Because here and now is a place of coordinated attacks on libraries, in education, and on many peoples' rights to even exist. ""My advice is to stay away from texts that promote a potentially sided view"" might sound reasonable at first glance, like okay, don't preach your faith, got it. 

But if you think about it for longer than a moment, this is the worst kind of 'libraries are neutral.' What senseless idiot orders steak from Waffle House?? @Super70sSports I used to pour over the Sunday Boston Globe sports section- the best in the country !

If we are to compete well in the Championship, it would be very strange to let Keano go.

What’s struck me is the amount of times the story has changed and the timeline has evolved. 

Thank goodness for the journalists on the ground pressing hard to get the facts straight.

These families deserve the truth and they deserve accountability. #Uvalde Work is finished,

Stop trying to make everything the High Line! I’m so sick. It’s not Covid. It’s just like a terrible cold or something.🤒 who keeps flagging shit on my finsta the point of having that account is to be concerning stop being a cop This is the most cogent explanation I've seen for what exactly the railroader demand for sick leave means. It's not the same thing as what the rest of us mean (which doesn't make the demand any less legitimate). One thing about having a disability or multiple disabilities. It’s people usually offer to help you one time and then they realize it’s so much work and then they usually don’t come back for a second time. #Disabilities.

I got into politics because I barely saw anyone who looked like me or understood my community. 

What I saw was AAPI and our needs constantly being ignored. 

We were told to wait our turn or dismissed. So I decided to be that change 1/ my flight to Atlanta cost me as much as my flight to Berlin. flights are out of control. I think we should stop naming things after actual people tbh

But I do love some drama so... Oh the townies are going to flip Maybe that's because the model of low wage seasonal work doesn't work No one talks about this kind of gentrification the younger associates at the firm just voted me as a ""Most Valuable Mentor.""

Her demeanor &amp; behavior w/ my staff was beyond despicable. I eventually kicked her out for cursing at me, insulting my business &amp; calling me a bitch and a CU next Tuesday THREE times. And this…

Nobody deserves any of this. EVER. https://t.co/NkpjXis8mb When I started running in 2019 I overheard a woman say “yeah I’m just doing an easy 5 miles today” and I was like WE GET IT YOU RUN and now I’m that girl being like “yeah Im just doing an easy 5 miles today” my how the tables have turned 💪🏻 https://t.co/oyR9OMmXiv Our #Boardgames Twitter Community hit 1,100 members!

I wish every company did this. My first conference talk I'm person in two years, coupled with my first @RedSox and bumping into @Leonora_Abd! Been a great conference so far! https://t.co/Y7WFxxr5jx Time in a ballpark does not count against your natural lifespan. #RedSox https://t.co/Z2jfxEUe6X This is how white people act when you call them racist for their racist comments Steve Nash said the Nets don’t plan on playing dual bigs to match Al Horford &amp; Daniel Theis — but said they might be more intentional about getting Seth Curry the ball if more touches don’t come regularly in the flow of the offense.

More for @NYDNSports https://t.co/5V36jDoHka I just started a dev edit of @KelsoBrew's wonderful manuscript with plants and exploration woven through it.

These cops would’ve surely cuffed and arrested (presumed) thug Jesus as a juvenile delinquent, trespasser, &amp; runaway. Oh man. It’s cold but I’m ready. Go Jays. https://t.co/dBRFuC9P6a If a commentator tweets callously  about a Black child being cuffed, I should not be shocked when he uses a misogynistic epithet to refer to a woman.

On the bright side, I don’t think a guy like Max Domi would have been an upgrade. Rakell is the only realistic one I would have viewed that way @AlohaBabez @BartimusPrime19 Yeah I heard LGBrandon chants in Cincinnati last November, AO/NT games in general bring some shitty people around, I'm on the board of my chapter but I still understand why people don't fuck with AO. #NHLBruins fans
I’m calling into @FelgerAndMazz now to discuss Hampus Lindholm.
Tune in! I’m disappointed that the #NHLBruins didn’t get Rakell.
But my attention now turns to Jake DeBrusk.
What do you expect from him now?
Also, Bruins got what they needed (left handed shot defenseman) and meaner on the blue in Josh Brown.
DeBrusk has to perform moving forward Earlier this morning, Cambridge Police, @CambridgeMAFire and @ProEMSCambridge responded to reports of a small group of protestors on the roof and another 20-30 individuals outside a building on Moulton Street. https://t.co/lPTyTWWpU2 glx for today https://t.co/a9q9RBsOyZ me in my apartment https://t.co/l15v3znJhf Why

Luv you all and positive vibes. started saying “buh-bye” to my coworkers and i think that’s the first sign that my brain is rotting Folks, I wasn’t kidding when I said that the #NHLBruins are in on Rickard Rakell. 
They’re in on him, it remains to be seen if a deal gets done within the hour with the #FlyTogether.
But it is possible, Bruins could use Jake DeBrusk in a trade with the Ducks for Rakell. We’ll see This tweet confirms exactly what I tweeted about an hour ago in regards to the #NHLBruins being strongly interested in Rickard Rakell. @Edelman11 Looks good! If you’re coming out of retirement, it better be with the Pats. If not, please stay retired and don’t do us like that! 😊😊 It’s a bit breezy out there, but other than that, no complaints! 🤩 https://t.co/qsT4m00p84 #NHLBruins fans waiting on any news on Jake DeBrusk potential trade

https://t.co/neUZbJrhS8 @Kira_Yarmysh @AVindman Like Mandela, Navalney will one day be president of Russia. Pray for him. https://t.co/EUaDS1sWgU This is a stepping stone to theocracy where religious orgs dominate various aspects of our lives and do not have to abide by any civil rights laws at all. They would be free to impose their beliefs on everyone else. Not to mention, Catholic hospitals could explicitly refuse to treat LGBTQ patients, single women, non Christians etc. In many places in the US, the only available hospital for hundreds of miles are catholic. This would be disastrous for millions of people. Over a third of all hospital and clinics in the US are run by Catholic orgs. Under this legal theory by Alito and Thomas, they could refuse to hire all LGBTQ and non Christian employees. This is insanely radical and creates sub classes of employees. https://t.co/rnO23ypoNy ""Today, for the 1st time, thousands of Cambridge &amp; Boston residents can board a train, leaving #fossilfuel behind."" @EdMarkey #GLX #greenlineextension #investintransit #trains https://t.co/tgX3xKPhDX @MichaelArt123 Like the Federalist Society?

Instead he drew the two defenders and believed that Tatum would make the winning shot This is how defense should be played #BleedGreen putting on a defensive clinic final seconds of Game 1 vs Kyrie Irving #BleedGreen Ime Udoka not calling a timeout in the game waning moments for me is something that stands out.
It showed me has an unbelievable amount of trust and belief in his guys which is why this team has gelled the way it has over the last 3 months kevin durant not responding to me flirting that’s fine i must get hotter or say some shit like “you lost tatum on that final bucket gumby” Today my mom asked me if I was dating a female friend that I told her I had hung out with last night and then she recommended a movie with lesbians in it that her friend’s husband saw and honestly, what an ally Riding the T home after an epic Celtics win, Boston is so back, it’s ridiculous trying to fit in with the locals

What a find this is. #arlington https://t.co/z75kkQwtYp Look at this beauty Jake Thibeault, who is the Boston Bruins banner captain tonight and said during a 1st period intermission interview: “I’m gonna walk again someday” We know you will, Jake and we’re all behind you, bud 💪https://t.co/gWQRG6l93y Nearly seven consecutive minutes of non stop play before the icing #NHLBruins On a night where the Bruins look like they may need it….Jeremy Swayman looking sharp in this first period, stopping all 11 Carolina shots he faced. 0-0 after one here @tdgarden - #NHLBruins #StanleyCupPlayoffs #wbz Incredible experience presenting our work at the #Metabolomics Hub of @BIDMC_Medicine and @JoslinDiabetes

Make it seem like a choice when it isn't. That's called denial. “The garden is louder” https://t.co/GjocxRlkCl @dcgolden @surlyurbanist I guess I've gotten pessimistic about political possibilities for systemic reform in big cities; everyone seems committed to catering to the desire for minimal change, no matter that it serves the interests of precisely no one. Incredible Banner Captains for G6: Jake Thibeault, the Milton Academy player battling back from a serious spinal injury, and Patriots RB Damien Harris https://t.co/autpDs1GGO RIP to a true gentleman, a heckuva tandem in the booth with Gil Santos for neariy 30 years, and a #Patriots K-WR that Bill Belichick would have loved to coach - and a player that should be in the @ProFootballHOF in Canton, Ohio. @surlyurbanist 💯. I think Rust Belt Twitter has always been pretty good on this but there's not enough crossover between them and Big City Twitter, and not all of what there is is productive.

Devers loves playing with Bogaerts. He looks up to him, thinks of him as a big brother, has been mentored by him.

If the Sox screw Bogaerts and he leaves, Devers might not want to stay, either. @kelly_carlin I wonder if he's saying ""I warned you all &amp; you laughed"" 😁

Keep doing life while training! Adoption is not without trauma…all around…for everyone involved. I’m not saying everyone needs to wear sackcloth and ashes every moment, but if you/your team/your business can go on as if nothing has happened, that sure is sign of the personal emotional safety &amp; privilege you feel, that many don’t.

Fuck you 🎧Episode 1 from @jistudents #GlobalScholarStories is up! It’s sunny and very cold this morning, precisely how it was five ago this morning when I arrived in Boston. Just absolutely stunning how it’s been 5 years already living in this city.

Today is going to be a lot of celebrating, a lot of reflecting. How does 5 years fly by??? There are good ppl out there. Gentleman left a note at our house saying he found my wife’s cellphone (ID pouch). Stayed put for an hour at a grocery store so we cld pick it up. AND he even charged it!!! I feel bad for Alec Burks. The dude is an 7th-8th man who comes off the bench and gets buckets. It’s border line not fair what he’s being asked to do. Credit to him for being such a professional. Another coach being fired I swear does nothing. It’s a hamster wheel for 20 plus years. 

That said…. Thibs has to make some changes, adjust some things, maybe find an IG basketball influencer to play, something needs to change, we know that. TUESDAY AM weather update ⤵️
Bright ☀️ but COLD day today… Warming up mid to late week with a period of heavy rain and strong winds Thursday night #WCVB https://t.co/xWQP8bBGSK Great conversation about the neighborhood with my friends in the North End at Trattoria ll Panino. ☕️ Showing up everyday, across the city, is what I will continue to do.

Points of historical context

📍Volume diff between groups was modest.
📍In 2001, pts were being under-resuscitated &amp; later negative trials had better baselines.

Where a woman uterus is regulated more than guns. I’m just soo gutted by the mass shooting in Uvalde, TX.

I don't give af what side of the isle you're on ..... DO SOMETHING!!!! Doesn’t the 2nd amendment include the words “well regulated” in its first four words? Translation: Heidi and I ain’t doing fucking shit. The ‘unthinkable’ has happened yet again. No amount of thoughts &amp; prayers or policing will put an end to the violence we’ve seen in Buffalo, Uvalde, and countless communities. Only major changes to our gun laws, real mental health supports &amp; serious anti-hate initiatives will do. Christ. In some parts of this country school children are better protected against trans people than they are against gunmen. Think about that. shout out to all the Harvard graduates today! I just got slammed with a two hour line with all of your families and friends, thanks for the new customers! these were the only two photos I was able to take https://t.co/mDHkti8yA6 not one good politician not a single one I don’t have the bandwidth to articulate any poignant tweet about gun control and mass shootings. I just have this deep sadness that these incidents occur so often. Countless innocent victims. It’s deplorable. My heart is so heavy for those babies and their families.  We need to do better!! 🙏💔😭 you do not have more rights to your guns than a child does to not be killed in their fucking classroom They were kids. Just getting ready for summer. May god be with the parents and families who lost their child today as a result of the shooting in Texas. We truly need to do better as a country. 😞🙏🏼 DeFi Dad(s?) night at the Gahhden ☘️

Congratulations for receiving the highest faculty award from Harvard students from all 12 graduate and professional schools.❤️✊🏾 I am inconsolable. No amount of thoughts and prayers will suffice. What could possibly be a balm for the 14 families who have just lost their child? 

Nothing short of sweeping gun reform will do. Not one more. The mental illness that causes mass shootings like the one in Uvalde, Buffalo, Sandy Hook, Parkland, Aurora, etc., rests ENTIRELY within the GOP.  They are sickened by the money from the NRA, while refusing to do their job to protect Americans. Describe yourself using coffee mugs from your kitchen. I'll start: https://t.co/dmLbxJKJ8A Imagine your 8 year old terrified in a classroom.  Trying to hide.  Crying for their parents.  Murdered in an unimaginable manner.  

Then realize this keeps happening because the GOP (owned by the NRA) blocks any law that tries to stop it.  

#Uvalde before https://t.co/TrF13mgkhn I feel like all I did when I was traveling was complain about traveling but now I’m sitting in my house looking around like….what the hell is this place 14 dead in Uvalde.  My heart breaks once again.  

The Democrats try to pass gun laws.  The GOP blocks all attempts.  

Guess which side is bought and paid for by the NRA? I’ll never understand how people can claim to be pro life but shrug their shoulders and look the other way every time there’s a mass shooting. This country is deeply disturbed and nothing is ever going to change if all we get are haphazard thoughts and prayers over and over again I was 8 when the Sandy Hook shooting happened and now 10 years later, it’s surreal that people my age are the school shooters. Cycles of violence, a diseased country to its core How many more will it take before we have the courage to say no more? Buffalo and Dallas was barely two weeks ago. 

14 children and 1 teacher. 15 precious lives. This isn’t an isolated incident. This is decades of indoctrination and hate that is taught. Enough is enough @StormHour Tuesday’s Sunrise 5/24/22… https://t.co/B1kvtPwEaj When I was 8/9, I spent the summers in Uvalde with my mom.  The school is 88% Hispanic.  

Children won’t be going home to their parents because of the failure of the GOP to confront our country’s gun violence.  

We are the only country where this happens.  Because we let it. Mom passed away after a relatively short battle with lung cancer. Your prayers would be appreciated:

One of those tweet exchanges which has multiple potential interpretations. @JoePostingg Folks who believe basic macro think
 that this exchange as something like ""Have you considered that the Earth is actually flat?"" ""No."". The ink stained wretches report on the 1963 US Open from inside Brookline’s curling building https://t.co/BA9zaEGQNg Got a Nirvana T-shirt on and someone came up to me and asked me what my favorite Nirvana song is it kind of got me annoyed. @JoePostingg That interest rate increases would decrease inflation is sort of basic macro.

FFS why do you say the things you say? 2/2 I have, and will continue to fight for deeper police accountability, because the beneficiaries are always the communities we represent, not politicians. 

I don’t do theatrics, I represent the people; and the people want @DAKevinHayden to resign  #bospoli #mapoli 1/2 When you are caught in multiple lies, covering up a police misconduct case, and soliciting donations in exchange, you don’t get to call into question the integrity of myself and the six other elected officials calling for your resignation.

In summary, this is a serious book for a person that wants to make serious chess improvement.

If that is you, then know that you will probably never outgrow “Thinking Inside The Box.”

What more could you ask for in a chess book? 2/4

The chapters:

The Psychology of Self Improvement

Analyze Your Own Games

Training Methods

are all accessible and very useful for beginners and beyond.

Like Silman’s Endgame Course, you could study these 3 chapters, then put the book alway until you are ready for more.

But what if, say, they dealt up with the Lions, who wanted to trade the third pick in 2020, and landed Justin Herbert? Maybe we’re looking at something completely different. B’a Prez Cam Neely on Don Sweeney critics: “The narrative is frustrating to me. I’m tired of talking about 2015. If U look at who the Bruins have drafted (from 2015-2018) &amp; how many NHL games they’ve played, it’s among the highest in the league. Every GM in league makes mistakes” Panthers coach Matt Rhule had a lot of power written into his groundbreaking 7-year deal, so the buck really stopped with him. And I’d bet his one regret may be never finding a way to go all-in on a franchise QB.

His first-round picks: Derrick Brown, Jaycee Horn, Ickey Ekwonu Seeing every boy’s favorite “creative genius” make antisemitic comments and then seeing his culty fan base of grown ass men make jokes about it is really weird and harmful? Taste aside maybe you shouldn’t be fanning the flames of a guy with a really deranged/volatile fanbase? #OTD in 1889, my maternal GGF “harry” christian hansen was born in sæby, denmark. he immigrated to boston, MA in 1909 &amp; settled in revere where he met and married my GGM viola &amp; had 9 children, including my grandfather harry. they lived about a 7-min walk from where i live now! https://t.co/YJjiafq1kJ Cam Neely said it was “very fair” to view this coming season as one last run with this current group of Boston Bruins given the uncertainty beyond this season with some key players Don Sweeney said there’s no timeline on a David Pastrnak contract extension, but said that he’s communicating daily with Pasta’s camp. Best idea I’ve ever had closing hot mess was saying into the mic “I’m your last performer so you might as well give me the rest of your money”"

Big thanks to my wife for not including me in the video. https://t.co/jbmOkzLPub Hearing that Boston Bruins forward Brad Marchand will have an in-person meeting with NHL Player Safety for Will Smith’s illegal punch to the head against Chris Rock during last night’s Oscars. Would have been more appropriate to just mention Melnea Cass twice. Climate health = skin health. Highly critical talk on skin diseases among climate migrants and refugees by @bwhdermatology’s Dr. Alexandra Charrow. #AAD2022 #ClimateCrisis #ClimateActionNow #dermtwitter https://t.co/THWOsF5man I have some news I am going to share in a bit to break up the Will Smith Chris Rock talk &amp; roast.
Stay tuned This is disgusting. Welcome to Christian America. @ryno1185 Why did we not see Samuel L Jackson's lifetime achievement award? THAT is a speech I would have wanted to see I wonder: if I smack all the people that got my name in their mouth will I subsequently win the Grammy I been wanting? Last night for sure is no doubt a top 5 night in the history Twitter. I mean Will Smith literally broke the internet and even Undisputed on FS1 made a reference to last night’s smack at the #Oscars To have great connections and communication with others first you need to hold a space, be present and listen intently to what others have to say to you.

2022-03-05,"I feel like we all recognize that it's a problem when new housing in Boston is mostly ""luxury"" condos - you can see this by driving though a neighborhood.

The problem that you don't see driving around town is that more and more old housing is now a luxury product as well. Hard to believe it’s been a whole year since the 2021 title round, but it’s a privilege to call another @Hockey_East Women’s Championship Game with @BobDeraney.

Caleb's been a vocal leader all year Feel free to disagree or start a conversation below. - Poor price performance 
- Sparse users &amp; lack of network effects (no economy of scale)
- Founder is not engaged on social media
- Other L1 blockchains are seemingly getting a higher rate of adoption
- Foundation is headed by bankers, not “Silicon Valley” tech types Reasons to not invest:

- Algorand Foundation’s burn rate &amp; controversial spending
- Not EVM compatible 
- Not fully decentralized (permissioned relay nodes)
- No privacy features, lack of plan
- Underwhelming marketing
- Executive departures (Both Algorand Inc and Foundation) Reasons to invest in $algo:

- Great tech, fast &amp; cheap transactions, very secure, amazing core protocol
- Very good developer experience &amp; support
- Vibrant and growing ecosystem
- Very competent developer team One of the best parts of my job as a @BOSCityCouncil member is the opportunity to meet &amp; talk with our dedicated &amp; professional @CityOfBoston employees.

REST IN POWER 🍀 #jefereplay I loved being on Twitter and talking to all of you. Quick, where are we going now? My audience here is vastly different from my other socials &amp; I don’t want to lose you guys. There’s something amazing about the potential shutdown of Twitter &amp; that is people are sharing what they believe is their last tweets, memes, videos, hilarious moments, etc before it’s demise.
We should live life with today could be my last day on this earth mentality more often What an impressive group of people assembled by @maura_healey and @MayorDriscoll.

Please share to help these amazing military widows!🎗 https://t.co/6PCgM7628H I shared a bit about dealing with imposter syndrome in this one and every time I talk about it on the podcast, it amazes me how many people share how relatable the discussion is. 

Spoiler alert: apparently a ton of people feel that way. https://t.co/VfOZuDetUq Boston is cool cause it's like a miniature new york in some ways. They even have a ""Financial District"" too! This is completely in line with the new-UUP’s liberal view of “more engagement not less” &amp; has been blown way out of proportion. Just because it was a rally doesn’t mean the UUP agree with the nuances of everyone there’s view there - in principle they’re all anti-protocol /6 Understand the critical position - but the UUP have always been anti-protocol. In my experience, @RobbieButlerMLA has a proven record of engaging with people an all sides even when his views don’t directly align. /5 It also feels elitist to suggest there shouldn’t be engagement with loyalism. As much as I largely disagree with loyalism (particularly on the protocol) - their views are valid and deserve to be heard. /4 The Beattie-Butler UUP leadership has taken a refreshing position on engagement - not just with loyalism, but with all sides. @RobbieButlerMLA met the pope during a visit to Ireland. “More engagement not less” has been a Beattie maxim /3 UUP have always been ‘anti-protocol-as-it-stands” as far as I’m aware. The notion loyalism shouldn’t be engaged with honestly feels elitist to me. As much as I disagree with loyalism about NI protocol - their views are valid and deserve heard. /2 I very rarely talk NI politics but a small thread on why this has been blown way out of proportion🧵

If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope.’
-Barack Obama https://t.co/UArxK0dPDo It is crazy that this is literally a 50/50 split. That's why these bastions of power are built on exclusion. Once you see behind the curtain, you realize how mediocre anyone can be, even the most accomplished individuals. They thrive on the reputation of their name and its mystique. I often tell people that I am so lucky my career went the way it did and to end up here at Harvard. They'll say, but you worked so hard. Those are not mutually exclusive. I worked my ass off but you can work extremely hard and not end up where I am. I've been reading Becoming by Michele Obama and the line that sticks with me is this: ""I have been at every powerful table you can think of, they are not that smart.""

I haven't been at all those tables but it's been true of my experience at Harvard Law and litigating cases. 🧵 Happy #WomenInScience Day! I’m so grateful to the many women who have trained, supported, educated and mentored me during my scientific career. To mention a few, thanks to @sweetenoughbake @annette_macleod @CecileBenezech @MarleneMaPi @KarlaSuchacki @PeronaLab @SaraMaciasRNA Some of the most common calls we get are 911 hang up calls. If you accidentally dial 911, please stay on the line and speak with dispatchers.

The Michigan administration deserves NO credit. If they decide to do anything at this point, it will only be due to public outcry. Have now read the entire report myself. Alarming details, to say the least. What’s perhaps the most alarming is the knowledge that Michigan has had this report for 3 months now, and they haven’t done a thing other than to force Bancroft into “retirement.” Governor Baker — please sign the climate bill into law. It will make Massachusetts the national leader in offshore wind energy. And it will allow cities like Cambridge and Somerville to participate in a fossil fuel-free demonstration program, and more.

You might remember the prior report came out right before the pandemic.

(Can you feel the “however” coming?) “The superintendent effectively led these initiatives, despite challenges in managing a central office with entrenched dysfunction. They represent real progress over a short period of time and in some cases may lay the groundwork for transformational change within BPS.” Also, bet your bottom dollar that you won’t see in headlines how often @BCassellius is praised here (you have to read the text, not the bullets). From page 3: Guess what doesn’t help there? I skipped the opening letter, BTW, which has the stunning sentence: 
“Underpinning all of this was the lack of a stable, supportive, and trusting dynamic between schools and district staff, due in part to frequent turnover of superintendents and central office staff.” TABLE @TableBoston goodie bags from the Caffé were a big hit at the pediatric hematology-oncology unit at MGH. ♥️♥️♥️♥️ @MGHMedicine https://t.co/Iu6Ibwn6oj 1. “There are buses that never show up and you don’t count those as “late” and you didn’t change it even after we complained!”

I loved how he referred to them in a loving way. I’m just a guy from Nee Jersey, but to my ears and thinking, the speech of King Charles was moving and it touched upon the issues that needed to be addressed, providing a sense of humanity, continuity and progress.

I don’t see myself cooking for the foreseeable future #Heatwave I have been quiet most of the time on this because I don’t know if my perspective is needed. But I have been asked for it, and I do have the experience, both on the bike and in terms of social or cultural critique. Still, I’m trying to tread carefully. I’m thinking out loud and rambling, and I still am not picking sides because I think all sides here are essentially right. But if you’re coming for the Williams Bros especially, and your critique sounds at all like it matches that of racists or haters, maybe pause before posting. Bahati got similar scrutiny. And sure, he had a chip on his shoulder. What field sprinter didn’t? He didn’t do anythjng other sprinters we’re doing. But it was easy for people to make him out to be an Angry Black Man. And he was the first to wear a camera and make a video. Absolutely everything we’re seeing right now has been happening for as long as I’ve been racing. That doesn’t make any of it ok. But it’s easier to watch it and talk about it. When I really think hard about it, the only thing that seems different about right now is GoPros and that the guys winning the races are Black. On my ride I was thinking about all the generations of sprinters I raced against in my career. Phinney, Gaggioli, John Brady, Alan McCormack, Dave McCook, Gord Fraser, Malcolm Elliott, Cantwell, Kersten, Nothstein, Bahati, Graeme Miller, Radisa Cubric, Hilton. 30 years of it.

Monday work 💪 https://t.co/8DnKO4cK4Y Again, it fits the cycling terf’s narrative to aggrandize and vilify me and others, and make up a story. They lost a big battle this weekend. They are angry and desperate today. We all showed up in person and if you were there, you know how good it felt. Their slogan is “we show up.” They did that. It made folks feel safe and supported, and contributed to the positivity we all experienced, opposite of what we expected. I was able to communicate what I leaned back to USAC and security. Later I thanked the @ctjbgc for being there, and for “engaging with me.” Meaning, when I confronted them in person for information, they were open and forthcoming, and happy to make themselves known. I introduced myself, immediately the rainbow and trans flags came out, they were “armed” only with radios, and said they were there to support the athletes and stand in the background. It was only after the race that I learned it was the @ctjbgc. USAC had noted them upon arrival and security was surveilling them, because it wasn’t clear who they were or why they were there. So I volunteered to engage them and simply asked them who they were and what side they were on. Literally what I said. While I share the political views of the @ctjbgc and I respect their position, I have a different opinion about weapons. I didn’t know they were coming, and was only alerted to their presence by the race director at the start of the women’s race. It shows my point from earlier that they’ll tell any story they can to make it fit their narrative. The “hours of work” I put in was with USAC on the phone communicating about what kind of safety plan was in place for athletes and spectators. What was the mechanism. Absolute LOL that super sleuths Inga and Alison have moved on from outing trans women to claiming I organized the attendance of the @ctjbgc at nationals. Me, the dad who doesn’t even let his kid play with NERF guns or play Big Buck Hunter at the arcade. What is going on in Qatar?? That moment of panic when I felt the crowd start crushing forward 😳

Palpable excitement I am 30 years old today. I’m in a much better place than when I was 20, and I think that’s all you can ask for. I’m so appreciative for my friends and family. As I’ve aged, I’ve come to realize that community is the most important thing, and I’ve built a great one.

It BOGGLES my mind that journalists, Royalists and all the other haters out there can exist in the same timeline as Prince Harry and his UNCLE Prince Andrew and have ALL the smoke for Meghan Markle &amp; SILENCE for Andrew. Do they think WE don't see what THEY do?!! Xoxo @RoyalFamily People on here have trouble handling that *anything* be multiple things at once or that something can have multiple truths.

It was once visually best parts of the track. I've never encountered anything quite like it in the digital realm. It is analogous to the tacit ""restoration"" work 19th-century forgers practised on illuminated mss, like the one I describe here (a forgery Peter identified!): https://t.co/xPT6dK8VPr Tacitly editing images of fragments seems to be her MO: adding borders where there are none, cropping for consistency of size, inserting a mis=matched binding, adding fake flyleaves, colorizing b/w images.

Excited for @ELangland9's final ride. https://t.co/W4JmiYL70D @alon_levy @drooliet The convo I've had with a few friends within the disability world, but that's too toxic to be had openly, is that the major, tho not only, way disability activists are able to be activists is through having a supportive family. People from poorer backgrounds are underrepresented. Just a reminder that if you haven’t picked up #BodyWork by @melissafebos, um — why not? It’s brilliant, a remarkable rumination on writers, the writing life &amp; the power of words. Please. Buy this today (or library it today!) @CatapultStory https://t.co/l9DIHigGDw A great talk from Dr Neelapu @MDAndersonNews on lessons in the nuance of CAR T-cell therapy - great insights into the importance of CAR T persistence &amp; especially into T cell fitness #lymsm #TCellRx #AACR22 https://t.co/UuKo25KaGt @alon_levy @drooliet And, to throw in one more factor that in my experience is significant: class status. Disabled people who can't drive are IME way more likely to be struggling financially. Sometimes, these can be the same person! Needs change and vary over time, sometimes on a day to day basis. why would ever you want a Tesla when you could simply have a nissan leaf and 40 thousand dollars Honest question: is there any discussion within disability activism (a world I am somewhat but not deeply hooked into) about how the interests of disabled folks who need cars as a mobility device &amp; those of people who can't drive are often actively in conflict? @drooliet Also, I have a theory that the language of universal accessibility has set us back here, as it leaves us unable to acknowledge that sometimes access needs really do compete and what is in one person's interest might impact someone else negatively. @drooliet An unfortunate dynamic in accessibility discussions is that many people, consciously or not, assume their own disabilities are the ruling factor, and don't attempt to think about what might be accessible to *most* people. Thankful for investigative journalists keeping up the pressure. 
Thankful for our auditor &amp; the findings of the forensic audit.

I’m mulling how a spring primary or actual engagement by @maura_healey would have impacted this race #mapoli all of you are soooo down bad for kevin durant right now it’s cringe. not me though Schools need to consistently shift and evolve according to the needs of who is there. @PatrickTutwiler @LearnLaunch #FenwayInnovationSummit @BeschlossDC This has been ignored in Jan. 6 hearings. It is one aspect of the vote count scheme: stopping counts on any late-arriving votes. It was surely something you can imagine the GOP would have wanted to challenge on court. If so, this relates to premeditation and suggests conspiracy. I'm very excited to announce that I've received a confusing email from a program officer with ""potential good news"" about a proposal that might be funded if we ""address these concerns to their satisfaction""! 🤷‍♂️ I can happily say I’ve lost 20lbs since last year 🥳 Second trip to the ER this week.

If you’re not serious about this, I’m not your guy I think about this at least once a day I’m grateful for folks like Prof. @bensiegel who called me in on this and for the Jewish community in D6 who I get to keep learning from.

This stuff is insidious and I’m committed to keep weeding it out in myself and my community. 5/5 Although that was not my intention, the impact —especially in a moment when we’re seeing alarming rates of violence against Jewish people— is the same and I should’ve known better. 4/5 It was made clear to me, that the use of the phrase ‘shake them down’ reinforces Anti-Semitic  tropes about Jewish people. 3/5 I maintain my disappointment with the eighth circuit courts ruling and believe that conflating anti-Zionism with antisemitism will ultimately prevent us from being in true solidarity with both Jewish people and Palestinians. 2/5 Alright ya’ll, my mentions are in shambles so just to be clear, I was responding to this ruling here. 1/5 The #WageEquityNow bill (S.2721) is foundational to eliminating the racial wealth gap that stems from race and gender wage inequality. For decades, employers have claimed to support eliminating wage gaps. But good intentions aren't enough.  @KarenSpilka and @SenRodrigues! #mapoli https://t.co/75Ap92sRDd &amp; there goes our Miranda rights…

But nor should we accept that current operating paradigms that increase conflict are the best possible world. BREAKING NEWS! 🚨🚨🚨
I just got nominated for the cover of PEOPLE MAGAZINE! @people @NationalParents https://t.co/1TZ4SMsN1G @nilocobau @marcscribner @mattyglesias @TrainsMagazine In short the only way to regain public trust in this particular process is to do what I've been saying for years: nationalize RTC and make it transparent and run by an objective outside party. @nilocobau @marcscribner @mattyglesias @TrainsMagazine Now, it's possible that Amtrak's two round trips per day could be extremely disruptive! But it's also clear that CSX and NS have been obstructive and dishonest at every opportunity, to the point of alienating nearly all their typical allies. @nilocobau @marcscribner @mattyglesias I don't know exactly what Amtrak thinks but the coverage in @TrainsMagazine and elsewhere has been very clear that the RTC inputs were selected by CSX and NS to be unrealistically unfriendly to Amtrak. Even normally sympathetic industry writers are pretty clear on this. Here’s to a TRIPLE OVERTIME #NHLBruins game 3 tonight (I’m joking 🤣🤣🤣) #StanleyCup Awww you mad? You salty? Wanna cracker?

Miami needs an outfielder, Red Sox need bullpen help in a big way. Should Boston give up on Duran for 3-years of Scott? The 28-year-old had a 3.67 FIP and a 12.9 K/9. Scott will make ~2.5M AAV.

hell yeah we are. life’s too short to be confined to being normal.

being in an animal headspace is the best form of escapism for me.

as an adult in the world we live in today, there’s a whole lot of reasons to want to be fox. 2) These just sound like things that furries do. 

Apart from the obvious answer that many furries exhibit therian characteristics, I want to emphasize the degree to which these actions are made.

Being therian involves a strong, euphoric response to acting like an animal. 1) These traits sound like autism.

There is a high correlation between neurodivergence and therianism, even more than furries at large. 

Thinking and acting in ways differently than most people aligns very closely with how it feels to be therian. WOW. The response to this post has been incredible! It’s awesome to see so many fellow therians relating and even more people realizing this stuff applies to them. 

I wanted to respond to a couple of common replies this post has gotten:"

#StetWalk https://t.co/uN5yJ8bYPZ This bill is being titled the 'Real You Act' which is setting up the state of Mississippi as the ultimate arbiter of your own self determination. Apparently, state legislators are better judges of who you are than you are. wicked games. https://t.co/0IpOEG9eUH Mississippi has introduced a new bill that would ban incarcerated individuals from changing their name and minors from changing their gender recognition through the court. This bill is a trial balloon to start banning trans folks from legal name changes.

AVERAGING IS THE MAGIC! @drorpoleg Not at all.

The sample tells us the percent of bot accounts in a given moment of time.

No assumption of static population is implied. @JoCoMicallef Doesn't particularly matter. What we care about is the sample of bots in a given time. Everyone squeeze in &amp; say cheese! 📷

You did not use AI, automation, or machine learning to writing this tweet. @JoCoMicallef We aren't interested in the number of bots in a day.

Every quarter, the sample is 9000 bots.

That's plenty for the relevant precision. @RyanRadia This is an amazing tweet @roboczar https://t.co/ZIxZT1JehE There are things that automation and AI is very good at.

But this is very much a thing where more data doesn't really help you that much. Cape Cod ✈️ Chicago! On my way #Road2NSPRA @ROAD2NSPRA https://t.co/bZTrzpxHXH Human reviewers are going to be better at identifying bots than bots.

The central limit theorem means that 100 randomly selected accounts/day (3,000/month) will give you a result very close to the true value. This...sounds like a really good methodology? @BeeAsMarine Either ban trophy #hunting or arm the #animals. Image from @bdanielsart. https://t.co/8DJFP5sBEP Had an outstanding day at Endicott.

🫠 Eileen was a top-tier housewife!! A great point. A lot of the development we see in and near big cities is being done by larger, more ""risk tolerant"" developers. If we want to encourage more “missing middle"" local development we need to make the development process more predictable &amp; less costly. 🏗"

If you truly want to book someone then you work around schedules and you pay the rate regardless. Would put money on that if they did book they would have cancelled on you.

If that's not a good enough reason please see Jan 6th, 2021! The neighborhood character under threat.. At the very least the ZBA should have some rationale why one building gets approved in one spot yet an almost identical building is denied in another. There's no consistent rationale or transparent motivations. It's just, you know, vibes. I hate to accept the choices are between a corrupt board or a board that capriciously blocks buildings with no rhyme or reason. Yet here we are. I said instead of going to see Black Panther in theaters get a passport and go SEE Wakanda Who the heck cares what Rohail Hyatt thinks about anything except for music? He’s not a gynaecologist or a political analyst. The same holds for all those celebrities people are endlessly disappointed with. Appreciate their art; ignore their dodgy political views. Polled 3 grad student friends about how appreciated they feel since it’s grad student appreciation week.

2022-07-03,"For the record I am not shaming or judging anyone who wishes to leave TST.  Nor do I have any ill will to anyone who has chosen to. Satanism is about working together and helping others who think the same. If you don’t just know, I see you. 👀 There’s an old saying that in order to be famous, you have to be an asshole. TST has never been about allowing assholes into its organization and if you’re like that then this isn’t the place for you. So don’t believe everything these folks are saying on the internet. So for the record, I fully support TST, it’s vision, the people behind it. If people really knew the monsters and sociopaths that they help, they would know how badly they are hurting Satanism and they would be disgusted. Continued, when I see ex members posting my personal emails, telling and spreading lies about my close friends I only ask myself, “were these folks ever satanists or people looking for a reason and a way to benefit off an organization which asked them to leave.” Continued, I’ve been a TST member for 9 years and have had the same treatment as anyone else. I have never tried to hurt others or used any privilege to manipulate laws and structure in place. I never started being “The Satanic Chef,” to be famous, Satan famous or with the intention of making riches. I did this because I simply believe in Satanism and want to be that voice for those who never had a chance to have one. Don't have the words to describe how much I love my bros and how proud I am of them both.  ❤️ 🦈 Teamwork! #CapeCod #boston #Massachusetts https://t.co/Wflge7roMH #phdlife week 196

I may not be able to bring peace &amp; confidence to the people of #Ukraine but I can try in my own corner of the world.

A good Sunday 😌 https://t.co/1i3INHvM4i Anyway learning a heritage language or reconnecting with a heritage language is a daunting task but I love to help people with it. Always open to DMs from heritage learners of JP or if you have thoughts on heritage languages 💖 You’re also not going to progress if you live in a place where there’s no need for you to use the language you’re learning. You have to alter your environment by creating the need to use it. @Sonja_Drimmer @BeineckeLibrary I discuss all of these distinctions and their historical contexts in my recent Florilegium article: https://t.co/LNpwWXOGEz Don’t have expectations for what you’ll be able to do in a language you’re learning that are higher than the expectations you have for the language you use most of the time! @Sonja_Drimmer Generally, binding fragments tend to be liturgical (b/c easily outdated or worn out) or school texts (grammar, theology, legal texts). Different story for cuttings and whole leaves, which are sourced later and tend to be decorated books of hours, bibles, or choirbooks. When we think critically about how a student will or wants to use Japanese, it often turns out they want to talk to their family, or talk about manga, or read the news. Those are attainable goals that allow us to spend our time and resources in better ways. When Japanese people migrated to other parts of the world in the early 20th century, the Japanese they spoke changed too. Language adapts to circumstance because it is a tool for doing something, and you will need to accomplish different things in different places. This is especially relevant when it comes to heritage speakers who have grown up in countries other than Japan. Why would you expect your Japanese to be the same as someone who lived their whole life in Japan? That would not have been advantageous to you. Always, jams https://t.co/qAQdMyXJZA There’s also no reason why “native speakers” should be the only benchmark by which you measure your progress as a language learner. People who were born and raised in Tokyo speak a particular kind of Japanese bc that is what is useful for their life. Maybe it’s not for yours! Any language is almost always fissured by class, race, region, profession, even time (!) and the illusion that it is a singular thing that can be mastered is a myth created by nationalism / nation states No native speaker of any language is completely fluent in their language bc no language is singular. If I were hanging around a group of rocket scientists speaking in English I would have no idea what they were talking about. I teach Japanese (language) and one thing I often hear students say is that they want to become “fluent” in Japanese. I don’t think this is a reasonable goal. Instead I ask: what do you want to talk about fluently? Who do you want to talk fluently with? I’d say that’s the season for Sale. Considering how displaced the fracture appeared, I’d assume surgery would be on the table to reset. Awful luck. You have to feel for the guy after all the injuries he’s dealt with.

When there were only a few #rhodeisland natives attended @EndicottCollege 94-98 &amp; one appears at your mini reunion wearing a #bennys t- shirt, you post it on Twitter https://t.co/ja5Wzpy94C The problem of course is that ""new people are good"" is actually pretty controversial inside the far left coalition! I believe that most of the committed organizers accept the principle in good faith, but a significant part of their coalition does not. Debate about whether building public housing is downstream of zoning reform or vice versa is stupid because both are downstream of building a social and political culture where growth and new people are accepted as good and ethically mandatory to accommodate in policy. i genuinely do not do shit on sundays if you made me do a single thing i would fucking die Ready for today’s Bagels + Butter virtual baking class!

#outdoors #monuments #backbay https://t.co/1CmIfanvp4 Since everybody wants to BE CLEAR today, let’s be REAL CLEAR - @MayorWu is ruining #Boston, suppressing free speech, and DESTROYING OUR COMMUNITIES. If you think this administration isn’t going to come for you at some point, you’re living in a fantasy world. Talk about chilling free speech… Had such a wonderful time with recruits on 3/28 ⁦@MITBiology⁩ ⁦⁦@MITGradStudents⁩ with #MSRPBio ⁦@KristinaELopez⁩ ⁦⁦@LopezGabriellaS⁩ ⁦@BertinaTelusma⁩ ⁦@ryan_elbashir⁩ ⁦@its_shandon⁩ etc….. COME JOIN US ⁦⁦⁦@MIT⁩ https://t.co/XcWwdHfToR @stoolpresidente Look I get where the restaurant owners are coming from in terms of asking why such a high price but they also aren’t acknowledging the costs to the residents in terms of parking, people carrying on all hours of the night, plus add the festivals all summer and it’s a nightmare time for me to slide back in his dms while he’s down https://t.co/8oSNA6Imhp @AnthonyMKreis thank you for recognizing us Now Aquaman catching strays for his weirdo words from the past, Zoe bout take down the whole family Fantastic to hear @CendanaCapital’s @gpingree give his unfiltered take on being a fund of funds for #preseed and #seed funds. Awesome to see so many of our @joinEVCA friends and thanks to @dolce_kyle for leading the conversation. https://t.co/cIrIaE3ZRP I’m genuinely humbled forreal. Thank you 🙏🏽 chef jd fanclub meetup with the chef himself @JDebrusk @destinymigwans @arimendobrik @NHLBruins #wearescreaming https://t.co/oKUFDJcOWV @stoolpresidente The north end residents told the mayor to stop outdoor dining. We have to park and live here. Out door dining was a perk during Covid to help the restaurants and we put up with no parking, dirty streets and shit traffic. They either pay for displaced parking or no street dining. Another day grateful for @BurlingtonMAFD as this semester’s EMS students got hands on with ALS equipment and learned about careers in medicine and the fire service. Hopefully soon we will have a graduate of this class as a member of the department! Thank you BFD! https://t.co/8r7Otagtwb I know they all have seen that Chris Rock hard er video with the pervert and yet they still riding for him. Fuck em @wutrain @CullinaneStory Why are you discriminating against North End businesses and the Italian community? You might miss it if you are catching up with the Twitter drama but there were a lot of reasonable restaurateurs who wanted to work with the city and Mayor Wu helped find a compromise.  https://t.co/5axZdCPEFr Hot take here:
Hampus Lindholm &amp; Charlie McAvoy being the top defenseman pairing for the #NHLBruins is certainly beginning to give me vibes of a defenseman pairing that helped the Bruins win the Stanley Cup in 2011.
They’re giving me Zdeno Chara- Dennis Seidenberg vibes. Well said. And I'm worried it's put the Mayor off her game if she can't make a clearer distinction in her messaging between the people who are harassing her and people who just don't agree with her on this policy. Celebrating becoming the latest @RedSox season ticket-holder! https://t.co/DzcKDOd7ar Light up the lamp tonight kehd #NHLBruins The journalist provided an accurate account of the situation, and now the landlord is claiming he suffered emotional distress (because he wasn’t allowed to personally rewrite the story).

You want someone with the experience and gravitas? Look no further.

My DM is open. Let’s talk. Getting my tits sucked Holding complexity is hard. I get it. But this should be the hallmark of Christians, that we are the the ones who can hold complex and divergent ideas at the same time. Without this, how do we claim the One who is fully human and divine? I give this gentleman so much props for getting his point across politely and respectfully. 
What Mayor Wu is doing is absolutely wrong to the businesses in the North End. If you want to be fair Mayor Wu, pick a room where EVERYONE is heard. @gabrielledrolet Is it okay if I made a meme out of that? https://t.co/rS9YfYxb1n We have a crisis of compassion in medical education.

Being a ""good person"" does not count you out from the REAL SHIT that happens in life! “I wonder if the #snow loves the #treesandfields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up #snug, you know, with a white #quilt; and perhaps it says, ‘go to sleep, darlings, till the #summer comes again’.”

The punishments of the ACGME often effect the residents more than the program. 

Yrs b4 I started res there were a lot of duty hr 🚫. The way the ACGME helped was to not allow us to have more residents (help).

Answer is 1/1000. Which is weird! The math is obvious, but as far as I can tell there is no ""natural"" intuition, which makes sense to someone who doesn't get binomials, for why this is ""A family has two kids. At least one is a boy. What's the probability that both are boys?""

Answer is 1/3.

#Ireland #FreePalestine https://t.co/Xh3RJaph2Q Would it be appropriate for FedSoc to bring to Yale Law school the membersof Atomwaffen or the KKK to discuss first amendment issues? You can make your point without legitimizing hate and genocidal views. This isn't just some mild disagreement. Kristen Waggoner of the ADF had advocated for imprisoning LGBTQ people, forced sterilization of trans people, the banning of adoptions by LGBTQ people, and the repeal of marriage equality. She's the general counsel of a hate group. If you aren’t following the @NationalParents Union Parent Appreciation week - recognizing unsung parent CHAMPIONS across the country - you are missing something special. There are new, different and important parent voices to be heard. But are you really listening? You see me on the cover of a magazine but this is actually my real life.

Yesterday, at least a half a dozen people stopped and commented on me washing my windows. They just couldn’t believe I do it myself. 

As a sole proprietor, nobody will care or work harder than you. Nobody. https://t.co/GI8QuRlAJy The FedSoc students who put on this legitimization of hate with the ADF will be on the inside track to competitive clerkships and firms. With a conservative majority in SCOTUS, the tiny minority of FedSoc law students will have outsized opportunity for SCOTUS clerkships. This is the true cancel culture in the legal profession. Powerful judges, firms, institutions, and political figures will blackball you from employment if you challenge their authority and fight back peacefully against hate. A sitting circuit court judge is telling other judges to create a black list of Yale Law students to bar from clerkships. This is extremely anti 1st amendment. These students were protesting an anti LGBTQ hate group and will disproportionately be LGBTQ and BIPOC law students. “the history of racism against irish people is illustrative of the point that racial regimes are dynamic and changing and perceived differences in skin pigmentation are not and certainly were not historically necessary in the construction of racial logics” — @MAKCapitalism Fret for your figure and

I’m more concerned with loss of flexion (see Wilk, Macrina et al and Camp et al)

Also loss of ER compared to other side

The entire manuscript is digitized in a high-resolution open-access viewer here: https://t.co/nVMLXJl2Qy @BeineckeLibrary 46. That does not PROVE the VMS date and place of origin. It gives us a LIKELY date/place. Some argue that the parchment may be medieval but the manuscript is a modern forgery. I don’t agree – I think that the object is too complex, with too many layers, to be a modern fake. 45. Can science help? Yes! @BeineckeLibrary  commissioned carbon-14 testing and chemical analyses. The results: the parchment is almost certainly from the early 15th century, and the inks and pigments are consistent with medieval recipes. https://t.co/1pA2nu32la 44. The script has humanistic features that are similar to Italian manuscripts like this one @TheHuntington, so it seems likely that the MS was written in the NE Mediterranean region or Eastern Europe in the early 15th c., but we can't say for sure. https://t.co/z5gJ11l1h8 @CarolHaussamen4 @KatieOGrady4 Republicans Jobs are to make money for themselves. That's it @RepStefanik and for her husband to make money on gun sales. 43. ""OK, Lisa, that’s all really interesting, but when and where was it produced? And what does it SAY?!"" you ask. Well, friends, I am sorry to report that after centuries of study, we still don’t know for sure. 42. After his death, it was inherited by his wife Ethel, who couldn’t sell it. After her death, it passed to their longtime assistant and business manager, Anne Nill. She sold it to NYC dealer H. P. Kraus for $24,500. HE couldn’t sell it either and gave it to Yale in 1969. 41. Voynich spent the remainder of his life trying to sell the manuscript, with no success. He brought in medievalists, cryptologists, and linguists to study it. No one could read it, and no one would buy it. https://t.co/0QYLusfzk9 40. In the meantime, early owners left their marks on the VMS. Names of the months were added to the zodiac pages. The manuscript was rebound (out of order) and foliation was added, likely in the 17th century. https://t.co/mwNAncE4q8 39. We don’t know FOR SURE, but it is likely that the MS stayed in the hands of the Jesuits all that time, until Voynich acquired it (circumstances uncertain, but likely from the Jesuits) in 1912. 38. Here’s the erased signature of Jacobus Horcicky de Tepenecz (d. 1622), an alchemist in Prague, on the first page (visible under UV light). The MS passed from him to George Baresch to Marcus Marci to Kircher. Then it stayed in Rome for several hundred years. https://t.co/pEcOzL1DDF 37. According to the letter, the VMS was acquired by HRE Rudolph II in the late-16th/early-17th century. We don’t have any other evidence supporting this claim, so we can’t say FOR SURE that the Emperor owned it. But it was certainly the kind of thing he might have wanted. 36. How about the history of the manuscript? Does that help? Well, we don’t know anything FOR SURE until the mid-seventeenth century, when this letter was sent with the manuscript from Johannes Marcus Marci in Prague to Athanasius Kircher in Rome. https://t.co/gJXFny84LK 35. And why does THAT matter? 1) understanding the collaborative nature of the VMS; 2) digging more deeply into linguistic variety among the scribes. Every bit of evidence helps the linguists and cryptologists, all of which gets us closer to reading the damn thing. @leoba 34. The fact that in the botanical section the scribal work is by bifolium, not by quire or even by leaf, suggests that the bifolia are actually now bound out of order. 33. Why is this important? The scribes collaborate in codicologically interesting ways. As Currier noted, for example, Scribes 1 and 2 alternate by bifolia in the botanical section. Here's quire 4, where scribe 2 writes the 2nd bifolium only (thanks to @leoba for the #VisColl!) https://t.co/0gm3a7mmsE I’m honored to have earned the endorsement of @NASRCC_UBC!

The upshot is that I was able to identify distinguishing features of five different scribes and track each scribe’s work throughout the manuscript: https://t.co/qUmFEDDROV 30. I applied paleographical theory to the VMS using a tool called ArchetypeInk, which allowed me to annote images of the VMS with discoverable tags, pulling the annotations into a “lightbox” for comparison. Here are a few screenshots: https://t.co/x3FCAFFEtS 29. To apply the principles of paleographical analysis to the VMS, we are limited by two facts: 1) this is the only example of this writing, so there’s nothing to compare it to; and 2) no one can read it. So we can’t employ attribution or literacy. How about description? Enjoyed spending time at the 8th Annual Chinatown Stabilization Block Party last weekend! Was great to catch up with folks engaged in stabilizing working class households in Chinatown &amp; honoring our everyday workers. https://t.co/gKGBuFHVNF Now, where were we? Oh, yes. No. 28. Paleography is the study of the history of handwriting. It involves 3 skillsets: attribution (establishing date/place of origin by comparison); literacy (learning to read unfamiliar scripts); and description (distinguishing between scribes). https://t.co/SQOVBHNryK And we're back!

[intermission! Gotta go walk the dog...back soon] https://t.co/0X8hkpcDTK @anggarrgoon 27. I am NOT a linguist or a cryptologist. I am a paleographer and codicologist, with a lengthy track record of studying, cataloguing, and analyzing medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. That is how I approach my work on the manuscript. 26. In this article, @anggarrgoon and Luke Lindemann argue that Voynichese represents an actual human language; we just don’t know which one. https://t.co/QYQyEfrGDV 25. This is the kind of evidence that linguists and computational analysts like @anggarrgoon and @DrCLayfield use to draw conclusions about the linguistic properties of Voynichese. Is it a real language? Is it gibberish? Is it an invented language like Elvish or Dothraki? 24. And this combo is extremely common at the end of words in Dialect B but is extremely rare in Dialect A. https://t.co/y1Rs5JaQj2 23. For example, this ""benched gallows"" character is quite common in Dialect A but is rare in Dialect B. https://t.co/Cj5DTRCIaz 22. Fifty years ago, a scholar named Prescott Currier noticed patterns in groups of leaves that he called “Language A” and “Language B”. I tend to refer to these differences as “dialects” rather than languages, since they aren’t HUGE differences. 21. And gallows can be combined with OTHER gallows to create even more interesting characters: https://t.co/7ShbQ26hHE 20. These can also be interfixed into a “bench” to create combos like this: https://t.co/NM8kcBCrD6 19. Some of the most unusual and (for my work) interesting glyphs are these four, known as “gallows” characters. In EVA, these are (clockwise from UR) [f], [p], [t], and [k]. https://t.co/oRaLqhpQeC 18. Linguists also look at word frequencies, looking for patterns that may help determine what KIND of language Voynichese represents. Here are the top 100ish VMS “words,” showing how Voynichese obeys a linguistic axion known as Zipf’s Law (look it up): https://t.co/s91WxdkZ1z 17. The more-than-2% letter-frequency chart looks like this: https://t.co/fx6zE9t8AV 16. Here’s the EVA transcript of f. 2r. Important note: this is NOT a decryption! It is an ASCII-character substitution for machine-readability only! https://t.co/PdjJtEDcaj 15. Voynichologists have developed an ASCII substitution alphabet for Voynichese that allows you to transcribe the manuscript in a machine-readable way. The Extensible Voynich Alphabet (EVA) is used by Voynichologists worldwide. https://t.co/39d869ThXX 14. The linguists and cryptologists who have studied the VMS use strategies such as analyzing word and letter frequencies to conduct their analyses. But the uniqueness of Voynichese makes this process difficult. So Voynichologists have an interim step. https://t.co/HvzcUQSTkN 13. Now let’s talk about Voynichese. There are around 25 symbols that are used throughout the manuscript with different frequencies, and a few that are extremely rare. All of the common symbols can be seen ""in the wild"" on the slide at right: https://t.co/mdylbReVzI 12. The few lines on the final page (f. 116v) are roughly contemporary with the manuscript but are  written in what appears to be a Germanic language, with some Voynichese thrown in for good measure. https://t.co/1JfViAIx9i 11. The final section is purely textual, with 12 (of at least 14) leaves of starred paragraphs. https://t.co/2EtXkLuRUB"

It’s time to #treatOUD. https://t.co/dqTNUgFCiT This looks like it was taken from my high school year book @MilesPerHoward Arguing about whether the tiny amount of housing homeowners will allow to be built is affordable or market is the misplaced energy. @MilesPerHoward I think they are part of the same fight though. In Somerville the real power preventing new market rate housing is mostly the same one preventing public housing, wealthy incumbent landlords in Somerville’s wealthy areas. A growth mindset is the foundation for both market and AH. My housing opinions are grounded in the belief that change, sometimes rapid and jarring change, is part of urban life. We as advocates should be working to ensure that change is positive, sustainable, and inclusive, not working to prevent it. The pre-cast curbs work pretty well as a resting place for feet https://t.co/BENSSe995s Ptown for New Years w J https://t.co/rYLkBRvCfA It’s warm enough to work outdoors 😍 https://t.co/c9crboT5bY Somerville as a community is being literally strangled by housing costs. If your idea of a community is its buildings and not its people we have a fundamental disagreement on what a community is. @Satyriander Obviously it is more complex, but Somerville is not in equilibrium. People are trying to move here, people are having babies. We are growing. Keeping our housing in equilibrium is suffocating. @Satyriander I don’t think I should have to hope someone dies to have a place to live. Me: I’m still young

No one said he’s one of the best NFL rookie QBs in history, not even top 4-5.
But he did have one of the best rookie seasons by a rookie QB I didn't have a lot of time to get out during daylight hours, but I did manage to squeeze in a quick walk up my favorite tiny alleyway in town between meetings 🚶
#StetWalk https://t.co/dQuQJtB271 For a bonus, send kids home with enough at home tests for the whole family. Massive mess in @CambMA school testing last two days. Huge lines in the cold, awful info flow. Here's a thought: how about schools send covid test kits home with kids every Friday; they can test Sunday night or Monday morning and stay home if positive. Lines for Covid testing are blocks-long in Boston. It is absolutely *mindboggling* to me that testing still isn’t easier to come by 22 months into this thing. https://t.co/0bKL60PSqO Wow.

All I’ve seen is failed podcasts, horrific takes, and gender wars The USA sent out more cash to its citizens for COVID relief than any other country on earth. Under a Republican President. You could pay Americans to stay home, mask up, vaccinate...and they would simply take the money and do whatever they want anyways. I just yelled out loud. 💔

The High Spot Deli has closed.

They’ve been there for me &amp; my fellow journos from the Beacon Hill Studio years till just last week. 
So sorry to see them go. https://t.co/vgeXZK4dVp Counterpoint: the federal government is good at problems where the solution is to send money out to local governments and individuals to do what they want, and bad at problems where the solution involves making people do something they don't want to do at all.

It’s “constant monitoring.” (And by team, I mean the ownership and front office. Players always try.)

And they didn’t even *really* plan to build it this year, but the team is winning and fans are there, and it’s beautiful.

#transplant #dcd #dbd #CTsurgery #MedTwitter https://t.co/Q67G2Yfr8t The GOP is driven by the need of Trump and his supporters to compensate for their shortcomings with boasts and their love of guns. The Dems are driven by the simple imperatives of actually making the lives of average Americans better. One party celebrates a narcissist huckster and the other is busy getting stuff done for the American people. One is a perverse cult of personality and the other is laser focused on governing and results. BDE vs BFD. That’s US politics today in a nutshell: the big dick energy wing nuts like Kari Lake celebrate in Trump vs the big fucking deals that Joe Biden and the Dems are getting done.

He said “Your story and journey inspired me to change my life to make a change and go for what I want to do in becoming a tattoo artist” Biden believes in America. And this event reminds why America should believe in Biden. Biden remarks re Inflation Reduction Act are deservedly triumphant, offering a compelling, truly meaningful litany of achievements. He is energized. As he should be. A high point of his presidency and recent US political history.

They’re coming in from Oregon because the East Coast linemen called for help from other parts of the country—outages are expected as this storm continues marching across the US @accuweather @breakingweather Heart is so full💚💍 https://t.co/06f7wBWJo6 I did get to see RENT today at the historic Providence Performing Arts Center, and it was quite electric https://t.co/dvHgJgL11h I’m not going to sit here and lie to myself. I believed the #ForeverNE would be a playoff team in 2021. I didn’t expect them to fall apart they way they did in the last 5 weeks.
This is extremely disappointing the way the season ended.
I’m just gonna say this was a disappointment @RyanSmith_15 @BarstoolFran Excuse me, I abandoned the Pats when Tom left. Try to keep up. Matt Judon had 1 tackle tonight …… that pretty much sums it up.  @scottzolak #Patriots #ForeverNE Hwy @BarstoolFran, I’ll see you tomorrow and ill remind everyone my NFL team is Tom Brady… not a city. 

I love you. You’re hot. It’s what poverty franchises like the #BillsMafia do Things that we still need answers to - why did Malcolm Butler get benched &amp; what happened this season during the bye week….. #Patriots #ForeverNE Pats fans cold takes in #BillsMafia mentions... https://t.co/j1n8MVWu8Y My GenX upstate New York heart watched Buffalo lose FOUR SUPERBOWLS IN A ROW. So yeah I like what I'm seeing tonight. Remember that 7-game winning streak when people were talking about Pats-Bucs Super Bowl? That was cute Two guarantees in life (in Buffalo)
Touchdowns (by #ForeverNE) and dildos 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/zexCfpLVtL I want Phillip Seymour Hoffman to triple hole punch these back walls It's Saturday night and I have hot takes on Margaret Fuller, a largely-forgotten 19th c Transcendentalist writer, &amp; actually on her father Timothy Fuller, Jr too.

Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple lemon, lemon lemon, coconut lemon, pepper lemon, lemon soup, lemon stew, lemon salad, lemon and potatoes, lemon  burger, lemon sandwich. That- that's about it. Is this an exhibition game? #NEvsBUF Come on in. My treat. In the Court of the Crimson King (Taylor’s version) #Patriots defensive players must have been hanging out with too many #celtics players.  How do you not show up for a playoff game. The next mayor of nyc should be one of those fleshlights that does contractions for some reason see if i were the patriots, i’d simply just play better I’m at the Garden watching the Bulls/Celtics. The TV in front of me is showing the playoff game but I’m living in the present. Bill B has #patriots right where he wanted. Score before half and get the ball to start 2nd half. #ForeverNE Ill survive @shmanda @AngryLevantine Same here. One. A special one. Almost like a college team playing a high school team.
maybe if Steve Belichick put some gloves on - we’ll do better Am I crazy for thinking #ColleyvilleSynagogue should be the top trending right now? Be better, America. If the #patriots decided to take the ball first instead of defer there is a good chance it’s not 14 - 0 Buffalo- #ForeverNE  that’s mistake #1 I’m a Democrat, I fucking hate Trump and most Republican politicians. I’ve been political on this platform for 10 years… And my restaurant is sold out almost every night… And I’ve opened three businesses in 3 years. 

Not everyone gives a fuck about the Patriots, bro. 10 minutes walking outside in Boston and my mind retreats https://t.co/obuew8aOn2 Get the fuck over it Don’t ever speak to me again unless you are my adorable little weirdo https://t.co/53PcZwU0oD Saturday night takeout, and scotch that’ll make your knees weak. #randolph https://t.co/wIA2CYATYI Was out for a run tonight in Boston.

No mention of the high income employers who've moved in &amp; lack of new housing @Guadango We stopped because it gets ugly and becomes a push- pull with too much back leg. We nearly had a goalie goal. The HBCU National Championship game is going into OT.

It must have been one of Elon Musk’s followers after he incited violence. I’d put them at the same odds of Tennessee and Clemson playing in the CFP in the next two weeks All this Meg trial is showing me is that still .. in big old 2022 … black women ALWAYS carry the burden of proof in the court of public opinion. 

It’s so disgusting and disheartening to watch it play out in real time tbh. In case I’m banned for questioning Elon Musk’s actions, please follow me at https://t.co/YNezRQzPY1 @lasaristocratas Very much so. 2/ Why do I tweet about this so much? 

Because if we want Twitter to return to sanity, that means new leadership. And the most expedient way to do that is to help investors understand how overvalued Tesla stock is. 

Musk gets margin called = Banks own Twitter, not Elon. I just reported @ElonMusk for inciting violence against people who question Twitter.

How many people will be murdered because of his reckless actions? https://t.co/wf7aogj1F6 Tesla stock now firmly at $149.08 in after-hours trading. 

This is huge. And according to Fortune, the value is only going to plummet from here.

does this happen to anyone else???? Too many school leaders confuse action for progress. Committees, trainings, etc. But the only real standard for progress is nixing racist disparities in education. Students like Azavia are best situated to say how well we’re meeting that standard. Clearly we have much work to do. @BostonStrong_34 Imagine if the announcement was like “Boston places RHP Matt Barnes (Poor Performance) on the 10-Day Fake IL, retroactive Wednesday, July 1st.” For the third time in as many weeks, I saw a car crash on Storrow drive. I think it is past time we shut it down to cars and expand the bike/ped path along the Esplanade @MassDCR @EsplanadeBoston Idk if this is a Massachusetts thing but I’ve noticed that people who live in suburbs/smaller cities 30+ minutes away from a city usually say they live in that city but people who live in suburbs that border that city will say they live “just outside” or “near” that city I was proud to stand w/ @UNITEHERE26 outside Hynes Convention center to fight for workers.

The IMPLICATIONS of this.

Humans can photosynthesize. There’s two defenseman I strongly believe the #NHLBruins could in fact benefit having:
Ben Chiarot &amp; John Klingberg.
Chiarot is a solid physical defenseman who could be a solid top four defenseman. 
Klingsberg is a solid two way defenseman who add depth on the B’s blue line Rockland Dogs Hockey big win against Cohasset! 6-5 with final goal at the buzzer!

And the disposal of older and disabled folks is twisted, it’s just that these same people used children as an excuse, when they clearly only meant their own kids. I went to a stockholm hospital for an appointment in late November, and the unit was attached to the children’s hospital. There was a mask requirement, but even most of the staff ignored it. Not wearing a mask in a building with highly vulnerable children is just unforgivable. MORNING BOSTON! Sunrise stills from #bunkerhill! @bostonNHP https://t.co/99wNOyaiDW I also think excess death as a measure of Covid success is just about the most ghoulish fucking thing, especially in a country that seems to rely on flu season to clear out the high-need older and disabled folks. Flatten the curve, don’t stop the spread is eugenics on a good day. The double trauma that the CDC director is defending what the Swedish left has been arguing from the start, but at least Americans are furious. I have comorbidities and Swedes accuse me of being selfish for wanting to be alive to raise the kid I spent 8 years trying to have.

After a gorgeous sunrise, tonight’s sunset in Boston was also beautiful. #shotoniphone @ericfisher @TheBostonCal @NWSBoston #Boston #sunset https://t.co/cVJVQV9Asb There are actually quite a lot of fragmentologists working on Ege material. He broke up hundreds of books and manuscripts, so there is a lot of work to do! More here: https://t.co/qtpDiXFUCb Rest in peace Pelé. When I was a little boy in Korea, we all idolized him. Before bend it like Beckham, there was the Banana Kick and the Bicycle Kick. We all practiced for hours on that. What a King.

https://t.co/kYn6gx56Ze Chef's kiss on 2022. I love this website Congratulations to @LancerHoop on winning the Christmas Tournament 67-56 over a gritty @AHS_SpyPonders team who finished runner-ups. Thank to each of the teams participating. #plusultra https://t.co/CZu7WDagVl I am SO PROUD of my students for this original, independent, and collaborative research! The surviving bits of the Office of the Dead suggest Use of Paris or Arras, and by digging into the Schoenberg Database we found a very likely candidate for the sale! Sotheby's London, 20 December 1948, lot 415. ""The Property of a Gentleman,"" Use of Paris. https://t.co/zcEWjs7Bq4 Did the five times I unsuccessfully tried to watch it count? But there's one more piece of the project. Once we've got the leaves in order, we can start digging into the recovered liturgy to try to determine Use, and we search the @schoenbergdb to see if we can find a sales record of the whole manuscript, before Ege got his hands on it. Some of the images are terrible! Some of the leaves are damaged and trimmed! Some only have one side imaged! But that's OK. Imperfection is the nature of #fragmentology. We lean into it. @FragmentariumMS The final result is a reconstruction that indicates lacunae, has leaf-level metadata, and adheres to best-practices in cataloguing, librarianship, fragmentology, image presentation, and @iiif_io. https://t.co/LEAu4cqHcz #AndrewTate and his brother Tristan have been reportedly arrested by Romanian authorities in human trafficking investigation. 

Karma is a bitch! 
 https://t.co/zs3VnjWLVG For this annual project, each student is assigned one leaf from a Book of Hours that Ege dismembered in the mid-20th c. They have to catalogue their leaf using the @FragmentariumMS application (https://t.co/mhRaVkECjd). Then we work together to put the leaves in the right order. 📚 This Waterstones Book shop - Bradford, West Yorkshire! #BookTwitter #BookLover https://t.co/AjoWfsZZlm Now that you #receptiogate obsessives know all about #fragmentology, say hello to my @SimmonsSLIS students' @FragmentariumMS reconstruction of #OttoEge no. 45, an early 15th-c.

By ignoring the work done by the rest of us, Rossi has created misleading and dishonest reconstructions. Plagierism, stock photos, &amp; website chaos aside, the lack of adherence to standards is really unfortunate, because the reparative work is so important and could be so useful. #Fragmentology best-practices have been developed by fragmentologists over the course of decades of meetings, symposia, publications, and collaboration. These standards have been developed with care are in keeping with modern librarianship and data modeling. These little survivors have stories to tell, and we shouldn't erase those stories through photoshop and intellectual dishonesty. MIT: My Inspiring Teens https://t.co/bdV05gyliz By contrast, I offer this screenshot of my own work on the Beauvais Missal, which includes leaf-level metadata and lacunae and the unretouched fragments in all their messy, difficult, inconsistent, wonderful glory. https://t.co/extsmpDxYU https://t.co/exWTRvxfY0 btw, I got that image from @mssprovenance OG post, which, it turns out, is citable! 

Kidd, Peter. ""Nobody Cares about Your Blog!"", Medieval Manuscripts Provenance, 25 December 2022,https://t.co/hUrs50dJ1Z Here, for example, are two facing pages (87v and 91r) that are not in fact consecutive, and you can see the unrelated binding peeking out from the edges. https://t.co/nat0NTpwL6 By photoshopping the leaves into an unrelated binding and not indicating lacunae between extant leaves, Rossi gives the appearance of completeness where none exists. None of this information can be found in Rossi’s reconstructions, so it is not possible to cite individual leaves, even though each leaf is in fact a separate entity. In addition, in order to give readers the full picture of the impact of biblioclasm, it is extremely important to provide leaf-level metadata for each fragment, such as dimensions, incipit/explicit, liturgical content, and, most importantly, its location. By contrast, I would point you to this valuable @digitalmedieval case study by @ISASaxonists, in which she experiments with digital repairs to the Exeter Book. The honest and transparent way to do such manips is to show exactly where the manipulations are: https://t.co/J0lCVFgVbh https://t.co/Eq5SgS5Chk Rossi does all of those things, without telling her readers that that’s what going on. The reconstructions are very pretty, but they are not honest. Readers are shown completeness where none exists. Two of the touchstones of best-practices for digital fragmentology is transparency and intellectual honesty. We (fragmentologists, that is) don’t digitally repair fragments by colorizing, cropping, or layering, or photoshopping fake bindings and flyleaves. To her credit, Rossi is doing that too, working to recontruct recently-dismembered Books of Hours, transcribing them to allow for deep analysis of the recovered liturgy. This is a very worthy goal, &amp; the transcriptions, while not always correct, are useful. So that’s great! But… @RealCandaceO Sit this one out Candace As many of you know, I have been working closely with @FragmentariumMS and many other scholars for decades to develop best-practices for cataloguing, data-modeling, and digital reconstructions of dismembered manuscripts, i.e. #fragmentology I know we're all obsessed with the stream of discoveries about #receptiogate, the revolving-door website updates, &amp; Rossi's doubling-down claims of innocence that are easily disproven, but I also want to talk about her #fragmentoogy work, which is troubling in several respects...

Some of these states can be flipped at any time. Strict abortion laws could discourage blue voters from moving in or staying. We know it’s not about the babies.

@GDTnews @GDTSports @noel_nmitch1283 https://t.co/DjnO0W8cqJ They continue to write on their page: “An unwavering resistance will meet all enemies of the people and the nation, both foreign and domestic. The LIBERTY of our people, paramount to our cause, will be secured.” The Patriot Front shares this on its page: “Our people, born to this nation of our European race, must reforge themselves as a new collective capable of asserting our right to cultural independence. The LIFE of this nation, unique among all others, will be defended.” There’s no room for cowards or hate in this city. The @ADL says “Patriot Front is a white supremacist group whose members maintain that their ancestors conquered America &amp; bequeathed it to them, &amp; no one else. Since 2019 Patriot Front has been responsible for the vast majority of white supremacist propaganda in the U.S.” 
#7News Mayor Wu’s response to The Patriot Front group marching in Boston.

So many good things happening in our city for us to build upon. #bospoli Gay slurs are lowkey hilarious to me because what the fuck is a “fudgepacker” Cocktail recipe pet peeve: listing an ingredient as ""amaro"" which is akin to a chef just listing ""protein"" on a dish. Often liquor brands who refuse to promote other products, but today it was an Instagrammer who probably lacked Nardini to make a Carroll Gardens.

“It all leads toward condoning drug use and normalizing drug use, and that’s a problem,” Baker said. https://t.co/z5lNNJlfEe Delighted to be in Boston to tell the @CDPB_NI story of collective leadership and a new programme for Northern Ireland leaders.

It’s “required” See our past thread for information on what’s happened in #Tigray and how you can take (fairly quick) action now to help out: The #WarOnTigray is escalating hard, and, while Tigrayans defend themselves and flee for their lives, the US and the rest of the international community must act. #StopWarOnTigray https://t.co/1AMGUF1Ej2 JASPERS COMING HOME TONIGHT!!!!

And I don’t have all of the certifications that classroom teachers do. MPS is one of the lowest paying districts in the Metro Boston Area. (Ultra) cool stuff happening in the Lončar Lab! https://t.co/RtedZGlFri @A1__BostoN I worked for Malden last year. Academic issues are part of the strike. Terrible student to teacher ratio, students not getting their pull out services.

Who would like an outdoor movie theater during the summer &amp; fall? Movies for the whole family to enjoy. Disney movies &amp; Old classics, like Goonies, Star Wars, Jaws, etc… Like an old school drive-in. Popcorn, fried chicken, hot dogs, burgers, bottles of wine &amp; draft beer, etc..

Imagine any of the fucking clowns who have run against her over the years: keeping their head, continuing the important business of the House, being situationally aware of the cameras and documenting this shit for future litigation. Oh my goodness, I did not know this! Clay Helton was 5-3 vs Utah 

This means absolutely nothing other than me finding it hilarious Most important thing we can do is make sure the Board of Supervisors, which is majority NIMBY right now, doesn’t block this stuff.

We need to stop re-electing incumbents and their acolytes who say nice progressive things but block housing.

 https://t.co/7ar0LwbuPc I worry this is one of those things that ALA isn't just ill-equipped to address but actually isn't designed to address. It is the LIBRARY association - how much does type or style of management matter?

(I'm talking about the org mission itself here, not views of ALA staff) Some librarians (not enough) have been warning about this kind of private library management company for years.

I suppose it should've been obvious the rise in challenges would eventually lead to calls for more of it.

They come from broader racial ideologies that circulate in US society. There has to be room to talk about the problematic ways Asian American students are being used for conservative ends (end affirmative action) while problematizing the ways in which Asian American applicants are racialized through the admissions process itself.

I’m an embarrassment for expressing myself on social media?? I was so happy that I was able to stop by the @SJP2CALowerMill Spring Show. The kids will forever be my “WHY”….!!! 💙🙏🏽 https://t.co/9d5TiWhvwR What better way for @MattStrahm to make friends in Boston than by giving away free packs to fans.

We also caught @johnnyschreiber on the way into the ballpark and he ended up with the hit of the day (hint: it’s a teammate).

@MayorWu https://t.co/sWNGivR8Ii I had to get into *one* picture… with two of my favorite celebrities: Susan Wornick and Jim Boyd #wcvb #50YearsFund #WeAreBroadcasters https://t.co/TsSa9FSfkV Learning from guys like Pete Abe is what helps me get better everyday. Lucky to call him a friend! I was just described at work as “food motivated”. We normally use this expression with cats and dogs… Neely was pleased with the trade deadline and also how the season ended. That’s what Neely really meant.
What the actual hell is going on with the #NHLBruins front office and the direction of this organization. I really don’t like this at all. @Mule_Rock @oldguy_steve There are a lot of people in that administration that can’t manage their position I am pissed that Cam Neely is working on a contract extension for Don Sweeney. On so many levels I 🤬 hate this soo much for the #NHLBruins Boston Police recovered a firearm at Charlestown High School. A 13-year-old is in custody. Just before 11am some students and staff waited outside for the all clear earlier while others were moved to the cafeteria. Several told me they did not know what was going on. @NBC10Boston https://t.co/3LNE38dyjk But also keep in mind that Tuscaloosa will bear witness to a joyless, rage filled, total beatdown of Texas A&amp;M live for 60 minutes on October 8th. Listen to the Saban presser again. He never said what A&amp;M and JSU (allegedly) did is illegal, he just said it was unsustainable. 

Then Jimbo comes out defending his program like someone accused them all of class A felonies??
Sounds like a personal issue. I am not some brilliant courageous individual actor, I’m a steward for the vision laid out by our movements, movements that are led by the people most impacted by the decision we make at City Hall.

Bro got on Jigsaw 5s imagine coming to a budget hearing and saying you need more officers, that people are working 16-hour days, not spending time with family, officers’ mental health is suffering and when you offer a solution to free them up, they mount up against you. Honest question for the Californians on here.  Price gouging law went into effect with the covid state of emergency on 3/4/20. How is gas up 47% if it should (by my understanding) only legally be allowed to have gone up 10% when compared to 3/4/20? An annual tweet for this #AAM2022: if you see me at an event, have nobody else to chat to, etc please say hi! I might be scowling or cackling with laughter but that's just the Philadelphian in me. Conferences are a lot, so happy to be a friendly face! Cam Neely said any decisions on the Bruins coaching staff will reside with Don Sweeney: “I think we have to look at changing how we do some things. I think Bruce is a fantastic coach, but I do think we need to make some changes with how we coach” Cam Neely: “It’s one thing to get into the playoffs. It’s another thing to lose in the first round. It’s disappointing, especially with the year we had. (Bruins ownership) is disappointed and rightfully so” https://t.co/AtXQgsJa0G Cam Neely said the Boston Bruins want to give Patrice Bergeron time and space to digest things as he decides his future, but “they have decisions to make too” with Bergeron a big part of that Cam Neely said there will be an extension forthcoming for GM Don Sweeney and discussions began after the NHL trade deadline babe wake up bereal updated their UI for the third time in a week"

Nick Foligno, on the net drive that set up his 3rd period goal: “That’s the Jake DeBrusk I’ve seen from afar” @mikefreemanNFL They miss the days when coaches ran programs with an iron fist. The tide has turned. But it is also amazing how coaches are escape criticism when they bolt programs and they get protection when they get fired during a season. @JeremyRubin @LNMarkets love @lnmarkets despite all my liquidations.  

that’s true love. moving to nyc tmr and I don’t have any melee friends there :( haven’t been this happy in awhile Awe! Tell your mom I said hello.

I’m done being walked all over and my kindness being used. 😘 What would you say to a friend who’s getting evicted and asked you to be a guarantor on his new rent application?

Overall, while 2021 was a massive change for me, it's been a good set of changes and a great shift towards a much more consistent, stable existence.

Today, we take a drink to a better happier future. Get vaccinated, mask up, wash your hands, you are loved. On this first day of the year of our lord 2022, I'm reflecting on the last year or so.

I feel better. I’ve struggled with drug addiction since I was 14 years old I’ve been sober from alcohol and cocaine since 2014 that was when I got my first guy dog Kramer recently I’ve been using medical marijuana $200-$400 a week in the past year that’s not really medicinal.

""AI"" people in 2022 - ""we might be able to help you trick a judge into ignoring your horrible driving but we're not quite sure yet"" asking me to do anything work related between now and january 3rd at 9am is literally just rude As an adult I’m literally shook at how my parents were able to raise me with the resources they had. They did their best and I didn’t always appreciate or understand the complexities of raising children in an expensive city I think it’s weird to fantasize about ways you’ll make your children struggle. If I’m blessed with children, I would want them to have every opportunity possible. You can teach values like work ethic without the trauma of lack.

Man, communicating doesn’t have to be that hard on this app, you know? Oh, and if you’ve got anything to say/ask about anything I share, for better or worse, I’m right here. No need to hide. Downtown was doing great before the pandemic, arguably better than ever. Partly because of all the residential. Well, that made it through just fine, better than most cities. Wonderful. So add to it. There’s demand, and there’s certainly supply. Will y’all stop vilifying us and take ownership for your sexual health now? The messaging around sex is still so dangerous The point here is to get freaking moving. Companies are allowing huge swaths of office space to just sit there.

#Match2022 #GenSurgMatch #SiSePuede https://t.co/dLY9IpibWz So let’s remember and honor the lives of those we lost. To love the families that are still mourning and now have to relive this tragedy. 

Much love, everyone Finally made it home, and look what was waiting for me. Talk about adding insult to injury! https://t.co/0yrDmDt3hS These are just my suggestions. I don’t speak for the entire community. There are orgs like @MassAPIsCAN that have been leading for a long time. So take time to learn about our community and the solutions to a safe society for us all 🤝 3. Do not go into our spaces and make it about you if you’re not Asian American. Abide by community rules and be there to support in the ways we ask. 

4. Most AAPI orgs I know are taking cues from @AAAJ_AAJC and the Atlanta Chapter in particular. I recommend that as well. 1. Check in on people but please add that they don’t need to respond. Everyone is different and some may be too overwhelmed, so knowing a response isn’t expected is super helpful. 

2. Don’t just say Stop Asian Hate. Listen to community leaders who have community led solutions A reminder that this is a really tough week for the Asian American Community. March 16 marks one year since the horrific tragedy in Atlanta. Since then, the violence has only increased and yet most of society has moved on. 

A thread on a few reminders for people this week 🙏 1/ I've double and triple checked all my documents for my RealID application here in less than an hour and I'm patiently waiting until my appointment time.

Some of my favorite memories are going to games w/ you, incl. the @RedSox ALCS in 2008.

My favorite was our 1992 road trip from CT to watch 3 @celtics legends (Bird-Parish-McHale) in their final season together. https://t.co/eUmd5T9zGd The best part of Bloomberg campaign chaos nostalgia is remembering that he paid his staff absurdly well so people were literally getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to make stuff like “meatball Mike” This is All-Star stuff Austin David Trapp - most eligible bachelor in USA!

This past week has proven that exactly.

If he doesn’t win his NHL-record 5th in a few weeks, there should be an investigation &amp; a public shaming for those that left him completely off their ballots. Yes, I feel strongly about this https://t.co/R8PGSzar5i @nellyomiles @MCOPALegal @piotoolkit @APDSmith @NAmmonsGBIPIO @FCkimble @jessedcarr @katienelson210 @SarahBoydPIO @PLewbel @GenevieveJudge @MCOPALegal makes complex law understandable and, dare I say it, entertaining! Such an important resource for the profession. 1st ballot Hall of Famer #NHLBruins Can he win on a rainy Wednesday Night, US Open Cup match @ Gillette tho? .@MCOPALegal brought us a great one!

Boston sucks, roads sucks, bike lanes are stupid, over priced housing that’s nobody renting or buying, MBTA STINKS AND ITS TRASH, bars here suck, no happy hour, potholes the size of lunar craters, BPD trash BPS TRASH, city racist lol the original list of seven wonders was made by Greeks, go figure https://t.co/mP14rqA1cd I believe Massachusetts will host the new Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health's headquarters.

The son of former Hawk great @Hasselbeck Henry recently received an athletic scholarship offer for lacrosse from the Air Force Academy.

We deserve better. #mapoli The @MBTA Orange Line is also a lifeline when you ride it to work, school, healthcare, or basic services. Glad to see this surge for safety, but it must come w/frequent, reliable alternate service during repairs. #transit #equity #mapoli @wutrain @MBTA Bus lanes need to be everywhere. Consider taking parking lanes to be pop-up bike lanes too? Travel will be disrupted, may as well spread that to cars as well as those who take transit From helping to set up the event in years past to now given the opportunity to help plan it. It was a surreal experience☺️

Thank you to @MayorWu , @bostonpolice , and all of our community partners for making National Night Out Chinatown a SUCCESS!!! https://t.co/H4lb5LCVwd i can’t act like im not interested https://t.co/y1LGl0WpDU IM SO FUCKING NERVOUS BITCH Respectfully, Mayor Wu: you have experts for this, and near-unilateral power to convert roadway to dedicated replacements for missing train service.

Please talk to your experts, and then act swiftly &amp; boldly to minimize the impact to Orange Line riders. THE MANEEEE 😍🥰🦊 Love these pictures. Our cadets did an amazing job at National Night Out!

@YevgeniyBr @TJHeartFellows https://t.co/vxB86iKYuo Lot of reasons - from fucked up individualistic views of the world to others suffered so you must to education is elitist somehow - these takes suck but the erasure one is what I'm steamed on today. I'm also always fascinated and, frankly, passed off by these takes on student debt. 

They erase everyone who comes from poor backgrounds, takes on the debt our entire society tells us we have to take on to succeed, and then lumps us in with affluence. The National Review doesn't usually believe class warfare exists, so this is a rather odd take for them. “This day gives us great hope!”

Too many goodies here for a tweet so go read the release notes! @di3tcoladrinker @MaseratiRiq Oh I understand y’all think colorism is one sided. I GRADUATED from an HBCU yet I still have a mind of my own. My institution was never an advocate of groupthink. Meaning I don’t have to think like anyone to have a degree. Next question? It’s obvious we did not coordinate our outfits

Houndstooth and plaid 😬 “To elevate, to exalt, to raise the Cross is to exalt the One Who died upon it in order to redeem our lives.

Foley and Juice combine for the shutout to advance to the Quarterfinals on Saturday! I don’t know if they ever did shift. My folks raised me on classical, &amp; I always preferred the heavy, powerful, or dark sounding stuff, especially in minor key. Stuff like Vivaldi’s Summer, Mozart’s Requiem, or Romantic organ composers.

I suppose I was destined to be a metalhead @Camillo_AD @Jared_Carrabis I got my kids initials… so if he got a Yankee logo, it would be fitting. No better way to celebrate nine years of marriage.

This was an awesome news radio interview! Despite positive reforms, I’m deeply disappointed about the exclusion of same-day registration, which is crucial for expanding the electorate. By failing to include it, the House is knowingly hurting housing insecure + underpaid residents. I’ll fight for SDR until it’s law. Looks like @mariastephanos and @EdWCVB are ready.

You go and interview the person in private and do real work not this momma basement nonsense you got going on. You got 24 hours. But you know, sanctity of life. Yes I’m a Pats fan, and if you were smart you look at the video I pinned to my profile I explain everything. But since you lack true intelligence and actually asking the source questions and see there’s a video where I explained everything, you’d realize there major loopholes. Greatness loading ahead of Game 3…

@JeffHsuMD @AliNsairMD https://t.co/VmpGaoXWo9 Happy Friyay everyone. I am trying to stay positive, but there are daly challenges. Spread love and try to be positive. A lot of “we do this” versus “when we do that this happens” exists in training discussions. It’s important to know the magnitude of impact of elements within a program rather than the results of the entire program. Not knowing the ingredient impact is just wishful thinking. Happy Friday! https://t.co/dtGKSquWBE President Biden faces a choice —

He can #CancelStudentDebt now, and the Dems will win the midterms.

Or, he can decide not to cancel debt. Dems will lose the midterms. And with the GOP in control, we will lose our democracy and the chance to save our planet from climate change.

Plus they are the high earners

And they rarely default

A film experience that was beautiful and captivating. And the idea of friendship, of family, that can break through the worst of times and help carry you through the dark. Sitting here today with a friend I made over twenty years ago, still as excited as we were standing at the #thefourhobbits #FANEXPOBoston What Lord of the Rings means to me - is friendship, family, fellowship. As my first introduction into what the world of fandom meant, it showed me that it’s okay to love something passionately. This series of books that were complex and riveting. A much better opening inning for Montas than his first time out in St. Louis. Strikes out one in a 1-2-3, 13-pitch first For anyone confused about what to do if a valued friend, colleague, employee is attacked for their research/views/art. You don’t even have to agree with said colleague! Just left FanExpo Boston and at closing both @MingNa and Ashley Eckstein had long lines. They both stayed after hours to talk to each and every fan in line. Amazing ladies 💙 After falling behind 1-and-2, Judge works a one-out walk in the first.

This will be the toughest task of any leader. 

America has to be aware of this. Either an enemy (internally or externally) envies their success &amp; tries to take you down or people on the same team fight over who gets the credit for the nations/organizations success.

One of the toughest things to do is to try to unite a group to work together knowing longterm I am not sure who needs to hear this-you don’t owe anyone any explanation when you make changes to improve your quality of life.

Speak up and speak out! Support women everyday! It’s the emails coming from *shocked* and *furious* legislators asking you to rush in $15 tonight so they can *fix* this someday. What a fucking joke. “Land of the free”? No this is becoming more of “Land of the controlled”.

I go to  my community garden to look at my plants. And while watering, some DUDE stops his car, gets out, walks over, jumps the fence, drops his pants, pees. Today Satan? Like I didn’t get the memo? Strip women of bodily autonomy and this man is marking turf. The BRAC process is already highly politicized. There's no harm in making states compete to provide troops with necessary healthcare. In addition to this, DoD should announce a full review of military bases in states than ban abortion and make it clear that moving bases is very much on the table.

But when people on bikes surround a car &amp; harm the driver, every headline was about “bicyclists.” “Born from jets,” I mutter to myself as I launch the 9-5 over every speed bump in the ghetto hard enough to get air. I need straight people to stop commenting on gay experiences without any context or insight. You don’t know anything about coming out or the plight of being gay in America. Also, homophobia in the Black community is very complex.

To my mind, the difference is, “Did you have a choice?” And, “are you a public figure?” Huge difference in public stake for a game developer versus a congressional candidate. @jdoobzzz @AdamSchefter It’s that extra $20 that really breaks the bank… When I ran for congress, I had to give my home address to the FEC, along with a ton of financial information.

Consider that many bus riders, cyclists &amp; pedestrians do not. And no one’s life “grinds to a halt”when a bike lane is created. Pretty crazy Elon Musk paid 44 billion for twitter when I get it for free 💅🏻 Cc @: everyone making decisions about the Acela 2 sets and FRA safety specs in general. Siloed safety calculations aren't safety calculations at all. With cycling on the rise in Paris, the City is investing $291 million dollars in 180km of new separated bike lanes over the next 4 years. An important investment and part of the city’s basic transportation infrastructure spending. 🚲

When you tell people to ‘calm down’. Why are there a million fringe socialist groups in Boston? What’s an ISG??? Join DSA lol Not that the message is incorrect, but media that solely vilifies ‘the other’ in a sensational manner will never win a single heart or another mind. All it does is create froth. We need strategy and cajones. I baptized a newborn at the last service I did before the pandemic shutdown.

Mental health issues aren’t scarier than unchecked, rampant gun violence. @MyNameIsntEffy Let them see all our messages coward IT’S HAPPENING YES We are honoured &amp; excited to be part of this historical moment for the Scottish Women’s Premier League ⚪️🔴

Are you taking care of yourself as best as you can? 

💙 This part. We live in a society of extremes. A handgun for protection is one thing. Assault rifles in the hands of an 18-year-old is another. Coming for semi-automatic weapons &amp; more thorough processes &amp; background checks isn’t coming for all guns. Stop it. Yeehaws on twitter don’t want their guns taken away because it’s their entire personality. A beautiful day in the Common! #BostonCommon @WCVB https://t.co/sRFR7JVJPT Beloved, you get to feel whatever you feel today: fury, sadness, resignation. You get to yell or keep silent. Do what you need to keep yourself and your community as well as can be. Each heart breaks along its own fault lines. But do not ignore it. Do not forget to grieve.

Christmas morning is still Christmas morning, at 17 and 15.5 as it ever was! 4) If the leaf isn't whole, don't photoshop it to make it appear complete. Fragments have been through a lot, and their history is an important part of the story, so don't erase that history by fakery and photoshop. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. 3) If there's no binding, don't photoshop the reconstruction into one. Digital reconstructions aren't about ""fixing"" physical imperfections by adding elements to make it look pretty. Wishing you and yours a very Merry Christmas! https://t.co/bIP1XXl4RI 2) If there's are missing leaves, show us where it is by indicating lacunae, as in this screenshot of my own work on the Beauvais Missal: https://t.co/wWNPjFS68k Yes, the wreath is made up of Blanche’s wallpaper banana leaves https://t.co/RfHjEET5RH Look, people, it's not that hard.

So now I'm wondering...is the facing page actually a photoshop job that layers a heavily-trimmed fragment onto a blank-sheet background to make it look whole? It's all so misleading!

How’d you like to be Jodie Foster and hear this news? The thing is...defunding the police isn't punitive, it's redirecting  resources like overtime budgetd to address community needs in more specialized ways. We ask too much of our police officers.

Racism and white supremacy are sins that extend beyond the South. They poison Euro-American children’s souls. Theologians must stop and address this madness. We cannot wait. “For, in the generality, as social and moral and political and sexual entities, white Americans are probably the sickest and certainly the most dangerous people, of any color, to be found in the world today.”

4. Homophobia also affects income, ability to have relationships, the freedom to love, and more importantly, the freedom to be ourselves.
5. Queer affirmative and inclusive practices in law, depression.
2. Homophobia not only affects mental health of queer folks but also their ability to access care- both mental and physical. This leads to poorer outcomes for queer folks in clinic.
3. Homophobia needs to be tackled in an inclusive, intersectional framework Since I had to leave the conversation by @TheSafecityApp , here’s a bunch of things I was going to say about #homophobia and it’s devastating effects-

Certainly genitalia can vary, even widely. It’s true that their appearance isn’t always, (but most always!) a reliable way to determine a human’s sex. Cases in which sex isn’t clear are exceedingly rare. I had no idea that birding was like, SUCH a big thing.

“Do you know where the South End is?” She asks.

“Yeah, it’s over that way. Do you know what street?”

“No! Just that I parked my car in the South End near a Dunkin’ Donuts.”

God help her. I made a short video for @BUDeptofEnglish of 5 books to read for Latinx Heritage Month. Check it out! Combining the stories of mill workers and their descendants, Franco-Americans and their voices, history and the present, my students left class with lots of food for thought. I appreciate their participation every single class. Visibility matters. #AmFr #Francophonie Students from New England were familiar with many of the cities where there were large populations of Francophone emigrants. They were shocked to see that there are still negative connotations affixed to these cities in 2022. My students were pensive. While talking about New England Francophones, I showed a clip of Jack Kérouac talking about his family in French. For many, this was the first time they had ever heard of the author. They were invested in talking about these communities and the stereotypes perpetuated about them. Today, I talked about Franco-Americans in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. For many, including students from MA, this was the first time they had ever learned about the history of the mills, of their environmental and social impact, of child labor, of the eradication of French.

Ready and excited to get to work and build the Boston and United States we need and deserve 🤝 https://t.co/6KBqDMZTkg Btw I don't think the reason agencies are slow to acknowledge this is really a huge mystery. It's a combination of stubbornness; crisis of raison d'etre; and (whispers) the fact that a future where the peak doesn't return undermines the rationale for lots of expensive projects. One thing that would be valuable would be for someone to compile what info is available on specific-train peak load factors on various commuter rail services around the country.

Upshot is there were two separate bills pushed into the omnibus. 

1. MAT Act = removed the X waiver.

2. MATE Act = reinstated an 8hr training requirement but this now applies to every clinician who is reapplying for their DEA license.

https://t.co/7CKgXDHGaB I hope in 2023 the T fixes their headways not so that service improves so that every other tweet on my tl isn’t about headways 8 hour requirement is re-instated but this applies to ALL clinicians who are re-applying for their DEA license. 

The so what here is if you want to prescribe any opioid; oxycodone, morphine, bupe etc you will have had to complete an 8hr training.

Chemical restrains exist (and they shouldn't require so much paperwork). @AlecStapp It is extremely weird that the consensus is slowly moving back to what CDC was saying in March 2020. @nanonomic @pboockvar Nope.

He's making a basic math error, and is just adding a constant.
https://t.co/wqHCZzEEcm the well-founded Massachusetts transplant fear that somewhere, not so far away, there's a town whose name you are pronouncing wildly wrong Good morning from greaseball https://t.co/p4BWqWIyua Ominous sunrise this morning. Very still harbor almost on fire. https://t.co/arl89AHx62 I'm sorry if I was oversharing here. Just wanted to say if you have people you care about who are unvaccinated or live in places with a lot of unvaccinated people, it's worth keeping up the effort to encourage them to get vaxxed &amp; wear masks. I wish I could have gotten through. https://t.co/5Bb2uGc6ld This pandemic has really taught me how absolutely terrible individual risk perception is and how resistant we become to adjusting risk perception to new data. Many people underestimated the risk in early 2020 and now many people are overestimating the risk in 2022. Good morning, Boston (and a very frozen-over Mystic River). 🦢🦆 https://t.co/86PIbHOmNc @BuffaloScott19 @scottzolak Wine and Cheese 🤣 I will be making the trip. Patriots Nation and I are not leaving without a victory. https://t.co/BrsKvvBSKH @chasestrangio I've felt that so many times when I was at TLDEF. I'd raise issues in cases that none of my cis colleagues would notice.

That said. 

I went from a fully unionized workplace to a largely non-unionized workplace and the issues around equity are exponentially higher at my current job. It's like we don't even expect equity to exist. And there seems to be no possible fix Self care meal last night while watching the Book of Boba Fett.

I’m so thankful to be part of the #NERevs family. TY ❤️

Got through the first storm and now I only have 1 thing to say: Remember this day.📕 “The narrative of the broken system is a myth; the system is not broken. We are broken…Noor, Priyantha, and our economy are victims of our silence and our lack of curiosity as individuals, communities, &amp; as a nation.”

Say what you want about CG, Shane Davis happens to have one of the keenest insights into the comics business and publishing industry. He’s wowed me in several livestreams with quick, deep, pertinent questions that an industry journalist should be asking too 🤷‍♂️👍🏻 I did offer to vote for it if the City Manager would agree to install a temporary barrier (traffic cones) by the original date of May 1, but he declined to make that commitment. I voted against the City Manager’s request for more time to install bike lanes through Porter Square because it wasn’t grounded in reasons permissible by the Ordinance and it didn’t even offer a new completion date. “By the end of construction season” could easily mean late fall! If you guys didn’t know I took a break from Twitch for a couple months. Working really hard to bring back the viewership I had before.

What at least once a year a girl needs to go through a smoothie phase No more water cups at the Braintree potle? I thought this was America Can people start learning the difference between “lose” and “loose” cause it’s getting on my nerves And of course this! I’m at the point in the trajectory of this post in which the trolls are beginning to weigh in. 

Grant me serenity &amp; patience. 🙏🏻 Here we go!! If MLB ends the lockout today, I welcome back all baseball fans in waging open baseball war against team rival fan bases.
On behalf of Yankees fans everywhere, this means baseball war against the Red Sox and especially Mets fans whose sausages are getting too big for its britches The most infamous moment leading into the Covid-19 pandemic, shutdown of sports, and life as we knew it as sports fans in March 2020 Here’s 3 ways Major League Baseball can regain relevancy in this country in the minds of sports fans: https://t.co/kRO0VyUrqv Gotta love the madre https://t.co/gN7sPeKd51 @dereksteez are you new here How long does it take for something to become ""normal?""

The range for habit formation seems to be between like 30 and 250 days depending on which study or fad you look at.

So by that timeline... the pandemic should be what we're calling ""normal"" now. Can't wait to tell my retired truck driver father that he can buy $9 IPAs at the old Cole Hersee docks in Southie. https://t.co/SdHmWNcYB1 Please keep wearing your mask if you come near me. With the removal of masking and similar policies, these large signs have become a relic. https://t.co/6dBkz1oc15 Thank you very much for inviting me to speak! i think it’s funny watching men genuinely argue about sports like are you okay lol @nihil_ad_rem How come gas prices go up under dems? The gop blames them &amp; campaigns on the issue. People believe it, but it's the oil companies. They don't want dems in power because they dgaf about climate change, but $. Every time there's a crisis, big oil takes advantage. Rinse &amp; repeat. @CWJediMaster I thought the same thing when I first heard about the p tape &amp; hadn't thought about snuff films in 40 yrs. A malignant narcissist is also a sadist. It's not hard to believe, he let 400,000 people die &amp; did nothing to stop it &amp; made it worse. He gets pleasure from causing pain. Nephews.

We continue to advocate for physically separated bike lanes out of the door zone across Metro Boston because we know these crashes happen, and that safer design can prevent these fatal crashes. We are saddened to share that a Somerville cyclist, Stephen Conley, 70, was killed while riding his bike this past Friday on Broadway in West Somerville. Conley was in a painted bike lane to the left of parked cars, when a driver opened the door into him. Looks like someone’s lawyers need lawyers here was he planning to flee overseas?

But if I’m tagged in posts degrading the incredible, innovative work of my collaborators, who put months and years of their lives into a series, I am also entitled to my opinion - respectfully of course, but also enthusiastically. We were thrilled to help facilitate a visit by the Boston diplomatic community to @NECEC and @GreentownLabs to discuss clean tech innovation and international partnerships. Quebec is grateful for our partnership with NECEC to drive clean energy initiatives in the Northeast. https://t.co/z3rMXc1u1j Now that we are coming up on end of year review time, here are some thoughts from a people manager on how to write effective end of year reviews.

1/11 YOURE THE REASON OUR KIDS ARE UGLY I don't understand why in a new development with a BRAND NEW street grid, we are still building door-zone bike lanes. We know what the best practices are yet CHOOSE not to follow them. Now we're stuck with this for another few decades. @Ammallon @realBurhanAzeem https://t.co/tZXJNUncEM It feels surreal to open up the @Athleta site and see this! 

It was so meaningful to model the bra I wore for months on end after my double mastectomy &amp; DIEP flap recon, and to represent our community of folks living without our original breasts.

Bills with real benefits for people, killed. Ice storm tomorrow… I genuinely think I found some of the best friends in the world. Y'all are some of the most optimistic, supportive, and friendliest folks I've ever met and you know who you are. If I go out of my way to interact again with you it means I feel this way as well. &lt;3 Happy birthday @AyannaPressley.

Does anyone else experience mixed emotions paying rent? I’m so happy I’m able to afford to live in a safe and secure space but also…. Adulting is EXPENSIVE When you arrive at your destination and Toto’s “Africa” comes on the radio, you stay in the car and listen to it to its completion (and maybe sing along). THIS IS MY HAPPINESS.

If anyone has anything to say about ANY woman choosing to not have kids (or not choosing due to medical reasons), you really need to take a look at your own life and your own happiness.

#nahaiwrimo Just shared my thoughts with Toby about the direction of the larger Star Wars universe since Disney bought it. While some of it is bad (sequel trilogy), much of it is very good (The Mandalorian). Toby is my cat. It was brought to my attention that the woman with the bullshit food tour in the north end that literally nobody I’ve asked has ever heard of, insulted my reproductive choices. 

My dogs ARE my children. BY CHOICE. And do women ever think that not everyone CAN have children? https://t.co/nK5UPdBMby I actually went to see this when Macho Man Randy Savage got this award. 

It was a lot of fun &amp; Savage was hilarious.

2022-10-20,"Connor Clifton just trucked Klingberg on this play:  https://t.co/FoC4w373oY This is NOT a homelessness problem! It is a #softoncrime, BIG PHARMA problem. Dealers aren’t being arrested &amp; treatment facilities aren’t helping ANYBODY. Addicts are treated as criminals rather than mentally disabled people, which is what they are when in active addiction. Does @MayorWu know ANYTHING about opioid addiction to even have an IDEA about what needs to be done to fix #massandcass? All I heard her talk about today was “affordable housing” …it has ZERO to do with housing options &amp; EVERYTHING to do with #publichealth FAILURE. #bospoli https://t.co/6Php50UM5D Haven't sat at second balcony for some time; I forgot how much I great it is up here https://t.co/J8Bq4ZHYDf Incredibly exciting to learn that cell biologist Dr. Sally Kornbluth will be MIT’s new president!!

I look forward to speaking to the @OVAC_Sports Varsity Board! my dad was there when liz truss was elected pm &amp; that night ended up in a London hospital with a severe intestinal infection that set off a nightmare 6 wk saga. TODAY, his infection was finally declared under control.

moral of the story: liz truss tried to kill my dad (n failed) We live in a society that tries to keep people as separate as possible both to extract max capital from them and to limit the potential of cooperation and thus, social upheaval. Loneliness is what this society is designed for. A side effect is, you may get laid less. The two rings are the exact same color of orange. The left one has a purple background with green stripes on top. The right one has a green background with purple stripes on top! #opticalillussion https://t.co/HSV0bwmzMF im so close to coming off private .. Seed coming in a couple years 🤞🏾 I’m just gonna stop logging on while on campus https://t.co/P419JOtl4o Men need to adapt, not reinforce the existing order. I understand that is difficult, but sympathy is not something  I really expect or look for, especially not on this app of all places. Especially when the assumed sexual availability of women is something that has largely been enforced with violence. And seeing the current social upheaval to reinforce that order. It's kinda no surprise there's a lack of sensitivity on women's part. That's just iono... reality. There are a lot of social and political factors that contribute to men's overall feelings of social decline. Discussing that primarily through the lens of the overall reduction in the sexual availability of women isnt helpful in solving those problems either.

LMAO THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE 🥹😭 https://t.co/Isp8jK0cpx The culture wars are so tiresome. Here is Joe Corsi and brother, Mitch, throwing out the first pitch at the @oldtimegame to former @RedSox pitcher Lenny Dinardo and current @BCBirdBall pitcher Evan Moore @MetroWestSports. The Corsi are wearing No. 41 jerseys, the same number their dad wore for the Red Sox. https://t.co/CIlPb10Wi8 Lots of people celebrating the news about student loan forgiveness and rightfully so.

You know who not only did nothing, but actually tried to stop it? The Republicans.

Remember that come General Election Day. Here at the @oldtimegame as Joe Corsi  (center) is set to start in LF &amp; hit first for the home team. This year’s game is played in honor of his father, Jim, a former @RedSox pitcher who died from cancer earlier this year. Joe is surrounded by his 3 siblings and mom. https://t.co/38QoafYg9R The boomers double-dipped: 

they went to cheap college on the taxpayers’ dollar, &amp; then refused to pay taxes for the next generation’s schooling

I consider loan forgiveness a payback to the youngs that got screwed by the defunding of public education What a summer Boston! Excited for the future! The journey continues. @WCVB https://t.co/koscX1H05G @friendchristoph And no weekend service in Cambridge! Older generations (boomers!) paid cheap tuition, heavily subsidized by taxpayers

I’m thrilled they didn’t have to borrow for college

I’m SUPER PISSED they launched a tax revolt that defunded public colleges &amp; thereby consigned their children &amp; grandchildren to student debt L.O.L.

#NERevs | #MLS I’m going to be in NYC this weekend. Where should I watch the Leeds United States match on Saturday? 🇺🇸💛💙 If @EdforBoston is rescinding endorsement, therefore admitting that whether or not allegations are true, the fact that he lied about the investigations is enough to say he’s a fraud &amp; not fit for DA.

It was fine. Hoping the administration keeps a close eye on *who* applies - and course-adjusts if inequalities emerge

The paperwork nightmares of income-driven repayment have disproportionately excluded the low-income borrowers who most need relief

Let’s not repeat

11/N I’m excited to see #NHLBruins David Krejci back at TD Garden doing great things like this: https://t.co/DvKAfJJMU6 But if you're a business, we'll give you eleventy thousand tax breaks and special pandemic loans that we will then forgive even if you pocket the money instead of pay employees.

Period. 

Cause that's the GOP way. @JohnWThurston @Rschooley Same. Also… maybe those freeloaders will buy dinner once in a while. I’m in. THAT’S RIGHT, AIRLINES, CAR MANUFACTURERS OR WALL STREET! @NHLFlyers The Flyers 2022-23 Season in a nutshell https://t.co/usWALcBW3B 😆 imposter syndrome https://t.co/VUPtyAkbu9 @0liviajulianna Will need to remove money from political system hard. This graphic makes clear how big a deal this is

ONE THIRD of borrowers have debt of less than $10k

Over half have less than $20K

MILLIONS will have their entire balance forgiven

https://t.co/wEIfLCLClX 10/N Can’t wait to see David Krejci again in a #NHLBruins uniform this October https://t.co/XjWPHrMVmy To honor the late Olivia Newton-John: many of our U.S. theatres this weekend will show her classic 1978 hit movie Grease, again on the big screen. An inexpensive $5 admission price, and through our charity AMC Cares we will donate $1 per sold ticket to breast cancer research. For another, if your argument is that college education usually leads to higher wages, that means people with college degrees are also likely paying more in taxes than those without.

So who would really be paying for loan forgiveness in this imaginary not how it works scenario? ""People who didn't go to college are going to be paying for those who did!""

I mean, for one thing, they literally already are through state and federal tax funding. And universities used to get a lot more of that. Part of the increase in loans is tied to decreased direct funding To be sure, many will benefit from the policy being announced today; it’s the result of an incredible efforts by many progressives — but it simply does not go far enough imo. Not far enough on the merits of good policy, and not far enough as a strategy for preserving democracy. grilling for my friends today❤️im scared A Black church the only space Black folks can yell, scream and holler in public without the police getting called on them. @RepStefanik @All435Reps You’ll have to speak up dear, I can’t hear you over the flushing sounds. https://t.co/ZTK1RmuNSG In addition to being an inadequate, structurally racist policy, this half-hearted decision means Biden isn’t doing all he can to stave of fascism. If Dems don’t sweep the midterms this November, our democracy is in greater peril. This was likely our best chance to grow our base. Instead of canceling all student debt, or the very least $50k of student debt for all, President Biden has done the technocratic thing Dems so often do.

Republicans will use this against us mercilessly, but the policy isn’t bold enough to give us a big advantage in the midterms. Is WAB ready for the upcoming cycle? Do we have the best Silver tier Twitter account? Are we ready for some amazing battles? Is @slothmansid going to make some questionable culinary choices this cycle? Yes to all of the above. https://t.co/ZjamUbjP8Q v*terans crying about loan forgiveness… girl you can’t handle loud noises so worry about that"

I posted this memory three years ago today on FB, and it’s worth bringing back! https://t.co/bSMS1tOqxc One project that we feel went under the radar &amp; deserved more time w/ listeners was “Watch The Chrome”.

Time to come back to State College (PA). https://t.co/7ENA4vmuX0 It’s unclear if Giancarlo was referring to a role *as* Loki, or a role in the Loki series. 

Personal speculation, but I have to imagine it was Classic Loki (which would go to Richard E. Grant) because my other guess, He Who Remains, has obviously turned into a film role. Means testing for government services is bullshit. I baptized a sleeping baby this morning. Like, totally zonked. Not even the water roused him from his slumber. And it makes me wonder what would have happened if I slept through my ordination? Never thought of that as an option. Giancarlo Esposito addresses the Marvel rumors.

He confirms he met w/ @MarvelStudios a couple years ago for a television role which they have since done.

#FightOn ✌🏻 My mom said that my plans to get FFS in January are affecting her health. Like I don’t know what I could be doing. I’m definitely getting it I’m really looking forward to it. So my friend and my mom were trying to talk me out of getting surgery saying I don’t need it and I look fine. Which I don’t think it’s true and I want to get it they just say it’s too dangerous getting FFS are you saying they’re worried about my future. My mom reached out to my friend and told her she’s really worried about me and the side effects from the surgery I’m going to be getting on my face it’s really frustrating because I’m doing this because I want to and I want support.

So, when we write about obesity, we have to acknowledge this very fact. Jayson Tatum had a bad Game 1 offensively. Yes yes he has 13 assists, but I said what I said last night regarding his maddening inconsistencies offensively. You can say Tatum had a bad game and still acknowledge the #AllAbout18 amazing comeback. They’re not mutually exclusive I’m really hoping that the #NERevs get this transfer window right. 

Definitely need to fill Buksa’s void quickly once his transfer is confirmed. 

Another solid midfielder &amp; a solid center-back would help as well.

When a black man, women, POC, explains to you about a racist experience they encountered, the last thing that you America as a country and society should do is continue to ask “How is that racist”, “Prove it”, “Why does everything have to do with race”.

I sometimes got into it with Hilton. But we never tried to split their train. Behind or over only. @spokejunky @JBrstl UHC didn’t put cameras on and say “come at me bro” and then complain when people did. @spokejunky @JBrstl The way they are riding is a direct line from Hilton Clarke. Hilton rode this way, Luke Keough rode this way. I do feel like there is an extra edge to it now, though.
