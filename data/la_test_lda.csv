But it's fairly easy, frankly. I think this is a good shorthand for what are usually a straightforward set of choices for most elections. Interesting that none of this was revealed after he became prime minister but before the 2019 election. It's almost like the British media decided to roll over to ensure Boris Johnson won the election to stop Jeremy Corbyn. Now that the job is done, they've cannibalised him. $UPST It’s almost poetic. #LizGossipNews😘💖 Motivation weekend the Turkish 🇹🇷🔥💥🥰 actor @AkinAkinozu https://t.co/7PBGJsLheT It would be hilarious as hell if it wasn’t so dangerously insane—MILLIONS of people believe this utterly deranged lunatic who makes Trump seem quite rational in comparison. he keeps me on my toes Y’all ever troubleshoot technological devices/equipment https://t.co/ScrYMvGPd0 my friendship w @ronnychieng in a nutshell 🎤 https://t.co/5xiB9PMglp @LakotaMan1 Agree.

When we call people sports adults or wrestling adults then maybe I’ll be ok with it. But 9/10 the connotation is negative. Also growing in So. Cal it is not strange to like Disney.

Cheap Trick 💯 https://t.co/nwsVdnYEB1 I broke this glass with my devilishly good looks and fantastic personality. https://t.co/nApvamJwMQ To all artists, musicians and entertainers! If your lawyer charges you 5% to look at your contract. Make sure you only pay them for the fee. If they try and get 5% for life on that agreement they are ripping you off! Trump falls back on his usual line to try and get out of trouble: “I didn’t know” Nick Fuentes. Shouldn’t a presidential candidate, or someone on his staff, Google the name of someone they agree to meet with? With Trump, it’s always incompetence and denial. https://t.co/2AQZvXyyie I ordered a fake-ass mini tree off of Amazon that allegedly will be arriving tomorrow; it’s my FIRST tree in my home.

Someone recently told me that they would share my content bc “they were cool like that” as a means of payment. LOL. Yesterday is what happens when Democrats lose 8 out of 14 presidential elections in my lifetime (including twice will winning popular vote) AND failing to exercise their power when they actually have it. Barack Obama was re-elected president and couldn’t even get his SCOTUS nominee a hearing, let alone a vote.

The @LATimes will continue to prop him up by lying to their readers that hundreds of thousands of unhappy residents and dozens of city councils are right wing ideologues. It’s sickening! We must be close to double digits on the Times writing in support of a local politician who just had 500 plus thousand residents sign a petition to remove him from office and over 30 cities vote no contest in his leadership. Gascon won many of the cities that now want him out. I’ve never seen a news outlet so dedicated to promoting a politician. I’m from back east, where the moment a politician is elected, journalists question and challenge everything they do.

The myth that we’ll ever return to the mainstream consensus of post WWII is inherently flawed. 

That was the anomaly. @unity4allkind @mojam29 @Logically_JC The economy has historically been better under democrats. There are facts and studies to back this up. It’s time to bring back prank calls.

Yeah, I’ll say. And yet all the deluded people who believe him didn’t need facts, just their crazy leader’s affirmation. @MLeoneStan @Joannafersulli @RepAndyBiggsAZ It’s not factual that God exists yet sooo many people identify as “Christians” 🙄 Proud doesn’t describe how this makes me feel. No strikeout, home run or play on the field ever felt this good.

I’m running around my office party yelling “ITS BIG TEN COUNTRY” Mark Meadows can be John Dean or John Mitchell. John Dean is a very decent, intelligent person. Mark Meadows is the inverse and also delusional—so I suspect he will choose the John Mitchell route and go down with the ship in a big way. He is in very grave legal danger now. anyone else feel like they’re on a country-size plane that’s crashing or am I just lucky @angela4LNCChair @LPofCT @AndrewYang @TheFreedomFest @LPNational I see he’s promoting democratic candidates. What was the point of creating a 3rd party if you’re going to help advance the force that’s hurting people globally? Are we diluting the woke machine to stay free, or not @AndrewYang?  I’m listening for him to say how he’s not a dem. Even though I’m feeling like crap, I’m watching a comedy TV special. LatinX comedian… and, I’ve literally counted four LatinX surnames in the credits.

Folks, he sent a violent mob to physically prevent certification. 

And he planned on using the military to seize voting machines. 

Sounds real to me. He showed up in his final regular season PCH Cup!

What a night, @0toEli.

Trust me, if you heard about this in any other country, you wouldn’t be debating whether it was really a coup attempt. Trump even drafted an order for the Secretary of Defense to seize voting machines! 

Just because Trump didn’t get away with stealing the election doesn’t mean that he wouldn’t have if he could. Kyrsten Sinema believes she’s giving her constituents what they want. 

If that were true, she wouldn’t have an 8% approval rating among Democrats.

Sources: Lakers have a strong interest in reuniting with free-agent center Thomas Bryant, but with LA just having the veteran minimum to offer he’s in no rush to make a decision.  Plus, the Lakers have competition for the services of Bryant, as Toronto is also interested. Gays are messy.

A Good Day. I hate how often this still happens. Today is a time more than ever the people are getting tired of the “americanized/cartoony“ versions of accents, yet almost to a T, every time an authentically-accented actor is hired, it’s the same stock response. “IT’S SO FAKE” &gt;:T Villanueva cites what he calls the Pottery Barn rule “you break it, you own it.” @RMac18 @kateconger @MikeIsaac Elon is the original snowflake Still haven't forgotten how you're charging artists more than AX does for an artist table (despite having a fraction of the attendees). Which is why I won't be in the lineup next year. 
But this statement is something all cons should adopt immediately. This one’s for my fellow Swifties.

I will never forget this day 😭 🚨🚨On May 28 come see the first film to premiere in the metaverse: “Hello World,” directed by Joe Horne, Noon Pacific in @OM100m featuring #mfers @DeadHeadsNFT @nounsdao @toddlerpillars @CryptoDickbutts and an NFT song by @SnoopDogg produced by @IntlArtMachine https://t.co/yOt1tvVNte Tomorrow is my final day in-person at @USCAnnenberg, and I’m not OK 😭 https://t.co/WVx3uz1Ikh This is gold. The whole 30 minutes was. Why does today feel like a Friday love that his daycare sends pics throughout the day 🥹 makes me feel so much better https://t.co/9FxWCHNVuC Here at @DomConLA and i am running into some of my absolute favorite human beings. So happy! ❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️ @DarkArchitect8 @USMNT Absolutely right we are not worthy, hope he stays home too Don’t let your desire for work distract you from understanding your worth… both as an employee AND a human being 🙂 All jokes aside, i had a really fun time rooting for Cuse this season. Apart of me died today. 

2023 is our year. I will be retiring the namesake of this account effective tomorrow. #ThankYouSyracuseWomensLacrosse The same way that an artist &amp; their team reserve the right 2hire and fire someone, at will..an employee that feels disrespected by an artist or their team (depending on the contract that they may or may NOT have signed), ALSO reserves the right to QUIT if they feel disrespected. Just had the most magical tech rehearsal at @MOCAlosangeles for this weekend’s Hi, Solo #11 taking place Friday and Saturday at 8pm! Feels amazing to see my art in this museum and to be performing with some powerful artists.

@WestCovinaUSD https://t.co/ubuo0EHaMU I can't find luxury menswear that fits. That's a big reason I don't do as many events, red carpets, or premieres. I've worked with some fantastic stylists that have gotten me through, but if the clothes that I like don't come in my size, there's only so much anyone can do. Just got back to LA but I wanna go to an Astros game 😤 🎶I will buy you a new horse, perfect shiny and new🎶 LOVE WHAT YOU DO, DO WHAT YOU LOVE. @mayansfx

They were made fun of, and signs were stolen from Jairo Rodriguez and Craig Walterscheid by high schoolers. https://t.co/VgfC9aLXpq These stunts are disgusting wherever they happen.
 
They are especially disgusting when they happen in Los Angeles.
 
This is not how a real Democrat or a real Angeleno campaigns.
 
@RickCarusoLA should be ashamed. https://t.co/cPBCsCcpkP Here is how Rick Caruso’s fellow billionaire Kelly Loeffler depicted Karen Bass’ congressional colleague Raphael Warnock in a similar attack ad: https://t.co/BCuNza8gy7 McCain against Obama
Loeffler against Warnock
Graham against Harrison
Caruso against Bass
 
This is what Republicans do when they run against Black leaders.
 
This wasn’t put out by a PAC. The Caruso camp is stoking racial fears by airing ads that artificially darken Bass' face. https://t.co/EesTU8Z3xM Love you all. x

2022-05-22,"I’ve heard people say it’s bad the birth rate is falling bc we need more humans to take care of the elderly. That’s an insane justification for treating women like breeding farm mammals. Humanely lower population is good for the earth. Less mouths to feed, less polluters too. A dude in the parking lot at eeeeatscon is selling pastrami out of his trunk and got mad when we didn’t want any So insanely excited to start demo this week.

Happy Sunday❤️ https://t.co/lRKqHgfEK4 one last time :’) @AmericanIdol @katyperry https://t.co/URjM5k98IG Trump went nuts on Truth Social today. The former President shared a call for civil war in America, ranted about the WSJ, scolded Mo Brooks, slammed Twitter, called for Jan 6 prisoners to be freed, complained about the 2020 election, &amp; called for Hillary Clinton to be locked up. https://t.co/bAaDfCxTqO What’s a goon to a goblin? @PlatChatPodcast Washington Justice is dead to me So happy I got to be a (small) part of it!

Many blessings and much love! @sergi_jimenez and Alberto Mielgo’s Jibaro in #LoveDeathRobots is astounding, gorgeous and heartbreaking. It felt like an internal and external “conquest” of death.

Third quarter woes…
#TENvsLAC Herbert forcing another throw or poor effort by Mike Williams? 🤣 Can’t leave him open 🤷‍♂️ can’t stop him down low 🤷‍♂️

#WarEagle https://t.co/o1xvq0phm7 @Tazerface16 Dolly is helping me wrap gifts https://t.co/FxmTo6wv2B Byard INT. There's a flag for holding on the chargers.

Marketing a release/drop is easy, finding moments after is where the success is had. In music, it’s concerts/touring. Same for @VceezyNFT. We have our digital venue “The Liftoff” going live next week for our first ever live “test” concert https://t.co/75RKIv6BrV Kings ! For those that may not know, I’m also a recording artist. I didn’t release ANY new music in 2022 and still had one of my biggest years in streaming. 

This is how I did it and how I’ll do the same with  @VceezyNFT … 🧵👇🏽

“Just setting up my ______” NYC Mayor Eric Adams has refused to cooperate with the federal monitor trying to make things less deadly on Rikers. This goes beyond indifference at this point. This is *state murder.* https://t.co/gkMHFhjf5a This has to be the most stunning Rosette I have ever seen. EVER. The colors are just 🤩

Don’t trust him. Reject him.

And he’s blaming “advocates” for Democratic losses. https://t.co/LKFxS43Q08 Almost all the guys he backed… lost. (Giggle) A jaw dropping, heart shattering listen Based on Biden’s approval rating &amp; historical midterm trends, Democrats bucked all presumed odds of a GOP shellacking. 

Ultimately, we owe our historically anomalous results to two words. 

“Trump” and “Dobbs.” I understand why everyone’s upgrading twitter but holy shit seeing all these check marks is fucking confusing lmao Bail reform means: 1000s free from cruel &amp; dangerous conditions in NYC jails. Millions of taxpayer dollars saved. And yet: Adams still wants to funnel that money into a bloated NYPD budget &amp; spreading lies to make it happen. 

This is Mayor's ""groundwork"" to ""end homelessness."" https://t.co/SVRVWUtI26 And as a Latina there’s so much anti black in Latin culture even anti indigenous, I see so many people claiming black &amp; brown pride just to still sit around and talk about black and indigenous people.

This is something else. https://t.co/AkpgGVzZhd Remember when Issa wrote something joking abt Black women and Asian men needing to link because nobody likes us and y’all got mad? The decisions that are being made in newsrooms about how to report stories around crime and justice are not neutral in impact.

Then rhetorically asks: “Tell us. What do we do w/ those inmates?” https://t.co/R7z5JWEswt The Peter Principle states that employees are promoted based until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent.

The Musk Principle states that bosses self-promote until they reach a level where it becomes undeniable that they are no longer competent. Query: Why is NYC Mayor Eric Adams fighting to kill bail reform &amp; cage thousands more when *all data now unanimously confirms* that bail reform &amp; decarceration have saved taxpayers hundreds of millions, helped keep people working &amp; in their homes, w/ no negative impact on crime? https://t.co/wFNta4WW8Q What’s better than sex?….pasta obviously.

We love you, @theestallion. If no one else has your back, trust that Black women always will ✨ Oh fuck that old lady. Jennifer Aniston confirmed mixie hater! One day someone will have to write a book about how the increasing infantilization of our mass entertainment  has perfectly lined up with a historically unprecedented rise in authoritarianism and fascism in our country.

When we infantilize black people (specifically black men) it opens the door to gaslighting their passion and drive as “mental illness.” LA is such a beautiful city 🤩

Underrated place to build a company too

Feeling like I need to host some more founders hangouts soon

Stay tuned There’s nothing wrong with @kanyewest - he’s having a normal reaction to a human experience very few of us on this planet can relate to (if anyone else could).

And all the media wants to do is call this passionate black man that loves his family “mentally ill.” First steps down this road.

So if you’re a marketer who hasn’t studied those examples—begin there. Did I mention it’s for a movie Getting paid $150 to make a single dish as a sample, you love to see it All this isn’t about humblebragging. It’s to say this isn’t as hard as it looks. Learn the lessons of these examples—bring me in and I’ll happily walk you through them, with visuals—and you can do it too—if your product also kicks ass.

Happy Saturday everyone 🤝 I lost $20,000 in a competition against cis women. A cis woman with height advantages. That’s a missed opportunity for me as a woman.

at this time. I’m sorry this is so somber, I rarely do it. But sharing these feelings is the only way I can keep them from swallowing me up inside. I will smile, have fun, laugh and just be at my happy place. It was our happy place too. But I’ll probably cry also... It’s not ideal, but I just have to do my best. (My bday is 9/30, she passed 10/1.) I try to lean into my life and fill it with as much joy as possible. But my sister was my best friend. She was my everything. It’s been nearly 8 years and it still hurts so much. Headed to Disneyland to celebrate my birthday for the next few days. But as always, my emotions are everywhere. This year in particular has been filed with so much guilt. My sister was a month into being 38 when she passed away and every year I pass that number it feels heavier.

But you have to put your all into music for this to work. The Finale matchup to Take The Throne chess tournament will take place @ 8pm PST today between the champions of the two throne rooms:
