Angels: (3) Brayan Bello, (4) Nick Yorke, (5) Miguel Bleis, (7) Brandon Walter, (15) Wikelman Gonzalez, (29) Shane Drohan, Nick Pivetta &amp; Bobby Dalbec?

Prospect haul, MLB SP &amp; more for Ohtani + bad Tepera contract. I'm too old for BeReal so my version is just sending my friends a picture every wednesday of the ""it is wednesday my dudes"" mug that they got me for my birthday As of now, seems like Jakub Zboril will be the first option when it comes to the defenseman that will be flipping over to the right side. Montgomery noted that both Reilly/Grzelcyk could play on the right side, if needed. A lot of lineup decisions TBD, per Montgomery, but seems like he wants to mix veterans with younger players across the lineup to see how chemistry works/younger players fare. Lindholm-Carlo might be split up to open camp. Jim Montgomery expects a “younger” lineup for Saturday’s preseason opener  against Philly. Lysell will likely get a look. If you're a Somerville resident but for some reason don't have Community Choice Electricity (CCE), now would be a good time to sign up. And at these gas prices, you might find opting up to 100% renewables surprisingly cost-competitive! https://t.co/C6VaDYoFMc Let’s meet for a workout in Boston!🦋

Maine in this respect is not special. Just about every city claims that it is under pressure from out of state buyers. The problem isn't mobility. Our national housing crisis would not be solved if everyone just stayed in the town they were born in. It's like saying our highway infrastructure problems would go away if people didn't drive further than 20 miles from home. In every city, it seems, people want to blame an influx of newcomers instead of facing up to the fact just about every city is dropping the ball on housing production. Boston needs a Green New Deal, but it's a bit concerning to see how Portland's implementation is making Portland's housing crisis worse. https://t.co/TgBOO5rLHB @ChanceBonar just remember that I loved you before you were famous oh no. oh no. oh no no no no no Hot Bean Juice

Love seeing everyone come together, share insights about the industry, &amp; unite for the common purpose of elevating women’s sports everywhere. You should be proud. https://t.co/COzUUppvMU I will always stand with the working men and women of @32BJSEIU! Thank you! The @BostonFire Commissioner confirms a worker has been extracted from the rubble of the collapse, with life threatening injuries. He confirms a surgeon was brought in to help in the process. https://t.co/HFcjPwEdDY @eduardoleonidas @fightuntil @RegionalUSFood even if you use a single steak or roast, you have to trim the exposed areas off. bacteria can only penetrate the surface level of meat, so trimming off the surface level should get rid of the bacteria. if you just grind up a whole steak you can still contaminate the ground beef.

My Dad’s Facebook prof pic every May 4th: https://t.co/sBbfYbUhQ7 Happy Firefighter Appreciation Day to the oldest &amp; best fire department in the country who has been protecting the people of @CityOfBoston since 1678. Boston became the first town in the nation to have paid fire fighters! 

#firefighter #actionnotjustwords #bospoli #mapoli https://t.co/dEgi45eRS9 I will always call you out on your bullshit idc Thank you so much to my mentors and everyone who nominated me for this award! @NAndarawisPuri @aechiou @PhunsizeDPhD @lauren_genova and my @KeetonHouse supervisor, Aaron King.

It is a huge honor to receive this. Doing my best to follow in the steps of some amazing colleagues 😊 Conversation with a patient in the hospital elevator: “What specialty are you?” “Pathology.” “Ah. Do you have to do as much education and training as a regular medical doctor?” “I AM a medical doctor.” “Oh yea, now I see, it says it on your ID.” 🧐 We got some work to do, guys! @LelandSage You'll be fine, Leland, because hotness is relativistic. I don't have time to explain at the moment, but you don't need to worry. Still so happy about our Celtics win last nt &amp; simply overjoyed when @kyletouellette Bianca &amp; I meet our Celtics family at games! Thank you @MsSamanthaMay @CelticsGRD @smars319 Love talking to you! 💚☘️ Hope to see you again &amp; meet more #Celtics #family at more games! #BleedGreen https://t.co/5hZjRzj8xG The team that made me say “May the 4th be with you” today on the Council floor https://t.co/7n9MQRPW8C Being seen as a plus-sized feminine woman feels like being a contestant in a drag show. I am feminine because I exist. Period. #PSBabes Arizona State is not just a train wreck, it's a delusional train wreck what is this is it a sex thing https://t.co/GdX2iwuMsP Some of the best/most important moments happen when the pads are off. https://t.co/KcSeI2ro97 It was GREAT to meet the Bstreet team!! Ready and focused on CRUshing it this year!!! @Nelsonsrm27 made my day…that business 🧢 looks good!! #SmallBusiness #builtdiffERen #attemployee #businessunusual #SmallBusinessWeek https://t.co/C2rD6D616R The prices at the supermarket are totally ridiculous. The not-so healthy food now cost as much as the expensive organic food (at its lowest price) because the healthy food prices have also skyrocketed. If you see someone stealing food, no you didn’t. scrumdiddlyicious 

 https://t.co/51UAUoliKN Getting the ratio on your very first ever tweet https://t.co/6PZvuL4GI7 Congrats @TrishaPasricha @MGH_GI! Super impressive and well deserved! #oslerpride Tech rescue by @BostonFire at the old Edison Electric building in South Boston. 776 Summer Street. Ambulances and fire trucks responding.

This is gonna be fun Glad to get the ""scholarship"" and attend the MIT future compute conference this year. Excellent insight from the industry pioneers into existing new technologies and mediums. I'm interested in seeing what will happen in the sports industry! #MITmedialab https://t.co/eU1XAeWINI Thousands of people hit the streets in Boston last night to defend abortion rights!

Excellent points abound, eg: “It’s very hard to achieve effective containment when the people you’re working with don’t think you care about them” - @Arrianna_Planey https://t.co/WRTI0bBG8p Miss New York City already so bad… shit that Burna Boy Madison Square Garden was 🔥🔥🔥 @BarbMcQuade I hope TST flies their flag at Boston City Hall. FYI: people should read the 7 tenets of The Satanic Temple. It's not what you think it is. 
First tenet: One should strive to act with compassion &amp; empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.. Like anyone else researching #internationalisation of #highereducation, I knew I'd come to @BostonCollege's prestigious Centre for International Higher Education,@BC_CIHE, one day.

I am so excited to be here to have first-hand experience of the US HE system and meet scholars. https://t.co/WJXh9ZgaAW Dear Rep. #Gaetz ,

Well they can! https://t.co/GugXHoQzZx You can’t approach therapy or any internal work with an instant gratification expectation. The “process” is the underbelly of healing and transformation. Truly understanding behaviors and what support/boundaries must be enacted We’ve also weaponized therapy as this temporary or transactional endeavor. Needs vary but it’s not “y’all need therapy” and the therapist prescribes a magic potion that suddenly grants you clarity and years of emotional maturity. It’s HARD work to fight for yourself A little secret: if you park at Timeout Market, tell them your coming to eat at the market, order something small &amp; get a receipt, which has a validation code, you can park in Fenway for $10, instead of $50. You have 3 hrs. Cheapest parking in this area. 

You’re welcome For me, therapy is about building sustainable processes for dealing with a multitude of things and recognizing personal triggers. We can’t impact what life deals us but we do have ownership over our responses and the role we play in various scenarios. when are we going to be ready to admit that the whole world is in mourning? we need a collective grieving period for what the last 2+ years have done to our psyche.

Sending spies to academic conventions and institutions, demanding “reports” from legitimate island scholars, is a tried &amp; tested tactic. It works Thats right, Mayor! This city is so special and it takes all of us to keep it strong and thriving. 

I will always be involved and active when it comes to the people of this District and this wonderful city! No lol it’s only allowed in the first trimester in cases of rape and danger to the mother (+ in cases of severe deformity in terms of incapacitation according to come scholars) and it extends if the mother’s life is in danger. Plz stop twisting Islam to fit y’all’s agendas Even if the outcome of the election is not what we hoped, I am feeling proud and energized. Our advocacy and work for D1 continues!

To all who supported us, voted for us, gave us your trust: THANK YOU!

I wish the new Councilor much success in this important work. So proud of the race this team ran! 

It was people-powered, multilingual, all about issues, brave, and fun! 

I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to meet so many in this District and learn from you, keep you company through difficult moments, and be inspired by you. #bospoli https://t.co/PqKYOwN79z dude i need my salary doubled the way i’m living my life ukraine moment .@Eve6 show &gt; my filmography skillz 🥰 https://t.co/PI7TUCLQI0 @IAmPoliticsGirl Talking to my daughter I said, ""these men must really hate their mothers.."" &amp; she replied ""It's not just the mothers, it's the sons witnessing how the father treated the mother.. they learned to hate women..""

The show hasn’t gone anywhere, just took time off because of Ramadan which just concluded.
Can’t wait to be back on the radio airwaves to sports with the best fans I see it everywhere, restrictions on what pregnant women can eat isn’t about maternal or prenatal health, it’s only about controlling women. 

but as a society, we LOVE to control people with less power, it’s women it’s people of color and it’s 1000x women of color abstinence-based sex education isn’t about sex and it isn’t about teen pregnancy (birth control is more effective!)

it’s only about controlling women. I’m sorry I can’t get into all the tweets about abortion, about ectopic pregnancy, about weeks of viability. you’re just playing into their hands. it’s not about that at all, who cares, it’s literally only about reducing the amount of power and agency women have it’s so fucking clever, they’ve manipulated a bunch of people into supporting their agenda of controlling women by making them believe it’s about saving babies"

Please read Kaitlyn’s statement. @SoniaChangDiaz deserves better and the constant erasure of women of color is unacceptable. We’ve seen this time and again on the campaign train. Enough is enough https://t.co/at89AKPKmT “Today, we applaud Judge Christine Roach’s ruling in our favor. In her decision, the Judge found the lawsuit filed by the Association strikes a matter of first impression before the Massachusetts courts…”

What you got today @LiamWBZ? I’ve been a harsh critic of Tuukka Rask at times, I admit the news of his retirement is truly devastating for the #NHLBruins fans and the organization. It’s simply a harsh reminder that great era in Bruins hockey is in fact closing People aren’t surprised about what’s happening at Harvard, right? The PI who was inappropriate towards me during grad school won an award for “mentorship” last year. It’s rampant. The day that Patrice Bergeron retires is the day I’m going to truly ball my eyes out emotionally. I just hope he understands just how beloved he is by the #NHLBruins fans, Boston/New England, and all hockey fans. Ours Too @ThomasPKennedy3 @LouTelano @ClubSpeaks @WitmerCarl I truly would not be surprised if Patrice Bergeron chooses to retire at the end of the season #NHLBruins Holy cow! So honored, @SLAS_Org! I'm absolutely blown away by this award and all the amazing talks this year at #SLAS2022. What an awesome end to a few crazy weeks.

@BCEagles https://t.co/QDdMQTYpff Troopers are telling protesters they are trespassing in a closed building and will be arrested if they don't leave in a few minutes. https://t.co/Ko3MAGGAYp I am currently observing National Pizza Day in the traditional manner. I love it when protesters tell TV reporters, during interviews, that the media doesn't cover their issue. Unbelievable pickup this morning I wasn't even really looking for.

Do what brings you peace and security might catfish a realtor into thinking I’m wealthy and taking me to tour million dollar penthouses This protest has turned to 10% about the State House not being open and 90% about how Charlie Baker is a ""medical raper"" and Michelle Wu is a fascist. You get the idea. They are upset about vaccine mandates and children being vaccinated. Ironically this bridge comes on a day when restrictions on mass are being lifted in schools Feb 28. https://t.co/qyfCA8HzsE Breaking: protesters have breached security and entered the statehouse. At least one tried to interrupt the Governor’s news conference. I’m told there are about 10. @MassStatePolice are on site and appear to have this situation contained. #Google Services 😂 https://t.co/PdxSThVUnA All protesters are maskless. At least one has a Let's Go Brandon shirt on. They're demanding the state be reopened. Protesters are chanting in the basement of the state house https://t.co/LYR6doriLY Zipping through the day.

Brookline is ready. Let’s go!!! 🚍 Breaking: In just minutes, @MassGovernor will announce the statewide school mask mandate will be lifted 2-28. Baker will appear with the state education commissioner Jeffrey Riley. https://t.co/fB6qoNoTTI I’m also really done with the term “homophobia.” It’s inaccurate. Phobias are what we fear, like spiders and arachnophobia. What is most often happening is anti gay hatred and violence. Let’s name the sin and violence for what it is. This isn’t fear, it’s violence against humans. Never. GOP opinions are sickening and bat shit scary crazy!  I’m actually sane. 

We are the most vaccinated state. The vax mandate didn’t bother me. I just don’t think it was effective. 

My staff wearing masks all day, while my diners don’t. MAKES NO SENSE! Thank you to @LydiaMEdwards for your endorsement. I’m grateful to @adrianmadaro @RepDanRyan @RicardoNArroyo for their kind words &amp; the partnership of @FelixDArroyo @TeamTram @KenzieBok @GerlyAdrien @MannyCruz_MA as well as all former electeds who are supporting me early on. We shouldn't let someone park like this for over 2.5 hours without towing immediately upon confirmation. Blocking accessible access shouldn't be just whatever the fine is, access should be restored. @KatjBallantyne @jake4somerville I definitely think the vax mandate was an absolute bust. Time to end masks, too. The numbers are plummeting. 

What are your thoughts, Boston/Massachusetts?

This is your sign to LIVE a little bit harder this week. 
💙 https://t.co/pxJyphmwJd A brief history: 

I used to dance all styles in a company. I had my first lead role at 13, and danced the whole show in point shoes

I “retired” at 17 years old to travel and go to college

Now my sister and I sponsor several dancers at our old company to pursue their passions❤️‍🔥 https://t.co/Y8vNb6nCvr ""Why fit in when you were born to stand out?"" 
— Dr. Seuss

Find what makes your soul light up and go chase it. Put blinders on and runs after your dreams with action!

I have missed dancing, I was a dancer in a dance company years ago
My goal this year is to dance more.

I knew I had to wait for Sunday Night Baseball.

@tzerhan29 @pjfoster @MullinsLab @wc_ratcliff https://t.co/hZuch2iYPY @rich_hillRBW @JeffPassan I’d rather Vazquez. Better hitter and better arm. Trevino can’t control the run game. Only 15% CS rate (Vazquez is 30%). League average is 23%, that’s a huge issue. Vazquez also has a higher OPS and is generally way cooler, which is really what matters! 😆 me marketing dani &amp; I’s book club https://t.co/h4MMuMWhS3 It is a matter of pride we’re hosting this year’s @AIDS_conference in Canada.

I was there in Detroit. Cassidy was as angry as I’d ever seen him postgame and Anton Blidh didn’t play again the rest of the season as a result. But I don’t think any one moment leads you to fire a successful coach like Butch Boston Bruins release next week’s development camp roster.

This has everything to do with the frustration we policy geek types feel when the public seems disinclined to hold electeds accountable. And it profoundly challenges the idea that politicians can in fact that electeds can in fact be held accountable for specific problems. a discourse we should be having but are not ready 👀 ☕️ 🫖 @vanyarana_ @tacamo13 @RebeccaRambar I mean, where are they going to go at that point 🤷‍♂️

#BruinsDevCamp | @MassGenBrigham https://t.co/SeZk0Wq8En Evgeni Malkin will leave the Pittsburgh Penguins and sign with the New York Rangers This tweet brought to you by watching yet another presentation at @GeccoConf made unwatchable by the presenter failing basic slide preparation guidelines; from where I'm sitting in the room, nothing is readable. If you really want to make sure that people will understand your slides, try reading them with sunglasses, while squinting, and/or with screen brightness turned down. Very often, the projected image will be dark and/or out of focus. (I'm not sure how to simulate colorblindness.) Next time you prepare slides for a conference presentation, step away from the computer and walk 3-4 meters away. If you can't read the text on the (laptop) screen from that distance, it's too small.

It was great to be in #Dorchester for our regular conversations to coordinate activities to better serve #Boston residents. Got a chance to chat with Georgii Merkulov in the Bruins dressing room. His English his excellent. Said he came to US in 2019 and could barely speak a word. Worked on learning 50 words a day &amp; said he watched a lot of “Big Bang Theory” in English to help him assimilate Trump ""is not impressionable child."" Debatable, Rep. Cheney, but we'll allow it. #January6thCommitteeHearings A disturbing statistic: in my 2017 book Boston Cocktails: Drunk &amp; Told, I cover 102 venues with recipes from 2012-2017 (after my first book). Of those 102, 50 are no longer with us. A person that's stingy on the compliments could never be a person that's for me.

According to @TSNRyanRishaug, #NHLBruins Jake DeBrusk's agent Rick Valette spoke with Bruins GM Don Sweeney last week and informed him that DeBrusks trade request was rescinded, and that he'd be happy to remain a Bruin moving forward.
What changed? https://t.co/NQF1dUpKgr I didn't expect to discover new places around here. (We lived in this neighborhood when we moved to Boston about 11 years ago.) And I was wrong. 

Today reminded me to keep wandering, to keep exploring, that this city will always have more beautiful things to share 💕🏙️
#StetWalk https://t.co/OwhFMZwxmn @bradleyhansen93 Boston is having the most amazing fireworks show along with the Boston Pops. I will not go. It isn’t worth my possibly dying to see fireworks bc some person decides to shoot it up. The police presence is already heavy. Dump trucks in place to keep cars out. It’s a fucked up world @jdcmedlock @thejb_stan Ita so weird to me that Casey Mulligan, Trump CEA and frequent NYT contributor has fewer followers than @bengrossbg. 😳 Oops that looks expensive! https://t.co/uV4T0s5HxE As an officer, you never know the type of support needed during a shift; whether it’s July 4th or not. 

Read more about the work CPD officers did this morning to help an elderly man, who is non-verbal, after his wheelchair malfunctioned. https://t.co/ssVMa5Ip60 #CambMA https://t.co/COkqKMxQxy @smc429 They all talk so tough but in reality they’re all insecure morons with fragile egos that can’t accept reality, our history, or be tolerant of people who are different religions they are. https://t.co/yoZDrUsPdY ***UPDATE:  Richard has been located*** Real time #AI for ESD/POEM may help identify blood vessels &amp; potentially even provide guidance re tissue planes.
 
I love the concept (&amp; the hype video), but it’s interesting to wonder if these tools can drive any measurable clinical gains (dissection speed/efficiency?) My dryer just died… Outfielder Jarren Duran of the @RedSox posed with Captain Majors on the field following a big 4-0 win over Tampa Bay! #HawksSoarHigher https://t.co/SssnWZ5uOA Horrific news out of Highland Park, Illinois.

That’s 28 more miles checked off. 
355 miles to Katahdin.
#rushtokatahdin https://t.co/hsxoCO4mdu 3.5 miles from the finish, with all the gnarly stuff behind us, we stopped for a dog-nap in the trees and for me to take it in. Through the tough parts, we often keep pushing or only stop for asthma-attack-prevention. It’s nice to stop to…just enjoy it!? https://t.co/ScgOplsETG Halfway down in elevation today, one more epic view surprised us before we buried back into the treeline for good. https://t.co/hhybrWhTXJ Not to put to fine a point on it, but these peaks were all fucking TOUGH. This is typical of the ascents, sometimes going straight like this for over half of a mile. Wylie is a gahddamned 33lb BEAST. And I sing him songs about his bravery as he climbs scrambles 😂. https://t.co/6YU77j6Xl9 I don’t know if I loved this mountain so much because I knew it was the end of the hard part, or if it spoke to me for other reasons. But I felt really right being up there today. And I thanked it for being awesome. Thanks, Mt. Guyot. I have a feeling we will meet again. https://t.co/C7nLiENx1y Wake up to this. Yes please. https://t.co/87zeWHACpH Early to camp (11:30 this time), repeat afternoon agenda. 💤💤 https://t.co/oXPLZAqDIh THE SOUND OF TWO 30 ROUND CLIPS DESIGNED FOR USE ON A BATTLEFIELD!

Because of their refusal to do anything meaningful about it Republicans may as well have been on that rooftop with the shooter, handing him more ammo as he murdered families.

https://t.co/AE5dE22ttV It was a great moment to soak it all in. We were gonna make it. Just had to be careful and stick to the plan. The dogs trust me so much and I was glad I hadn’t let them down, hadn’t bitten off more than they could chew. They’re really the best 🤍 https://t.co/SikVmBwC7c THE TWINWAY. 
We planned our entire day around this climb, including a 30 minute rest and second-breakfast outside the hut right before hand. Once we were over the top, before the heat struck, it felt like a load had been lifted. I knew we could finish. The worst was all behind. https://t.co/Gx5sQpJ32y And try to take it all in.
.
*full disclosure: Wylie was NOT trying to take it all in. Wylie was napping here, on the summit of South Twin Mountain after ascending “The Twinway”, a mile-long vertical gauntlet that took us nearly an hour. https://t.co/hzwdwR8e5q And then we start hiking though this. https://t.co/MiIJ0mWpJz And then we wake up to this. https://t.co/gPU6rWvfhJ What do we do when we get to camp at 12:30? Well, we make camp, and then we literally just hang out. Hours of naps, and pets, and playtime. Sometimes I bring a book but didn’t want the added weight this trip. Just lots of lazy bonding time, with no electronics. https://t.co/SbSXW4BCxv And friends, the skies began to clear ☀️
View back to Garfield from the Garfield Ridge campsite approach.
We cranked our mileage early, knowing that it would be heating up. The campsite caretaker was surprised to see us roll in at 12:30! https://t.co/1c0ZYQcwY7 AC STICKER HAUL 🤩 https://t.co/FeDk7jNWnP We found a fun pond to play around in between Mt. Lafayette and Mt. Garfield, and got some views back to the main ridge line as we climbed Garfield toward night 2 campsite https://t.co/JTHzONk45C @Acyn So much for the notion that “the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun” This picture of Wolfy cracks me up. The next day, it was cool. Yay! And even better, the rain petered out about 30 minutes into our hike, before we got up to the gnarly stuff. 
.
Enjoy the view from the second pic—the iconic panorama of Little Haystack mountain 😂 we could see maybe 80 feet. https://t.co/oVJ9mChTMg Force fed myself 3 cashews and a fruit leather for dinner and we tucked it in at 7pm. I knew a storm was coming that would cool things off, and we were in an excellent protected for lightning. And WOAH, was there lightning. Even through the tents, huge bursts filled the sky. Wrong. Problem. Big problem. 
It was still in the mid-80’s f when we started, and mom is as heat-intolerant as the kids. 
We made it up, but it wasn’t pretty. Loooots of rest breaks to let them cool. And in looking after them, I neglected myself and got mild heat exhaustion. Oy. https://t.co/ysgcS9svLr The route is marked above in pink arrows and numbers (and one looooong stray pink line that’s an accident wheeeeeee! Just ignore it). We went up Friday afternoon starting about 4 pm. Just 3.8 miles the first day, no problem, right?! This is…not an easy hike. It’s described here as “extremely strenuous…and rewarding.” If I’d told people I was shooting for it solo, with two dogs—they’d have said I was nuts. 
So I just didn’t tell anyone. https://t.co/8krdKGtTVi We just completed this 28mile stretch of the AT (+ ~2.4 miles getting to/from camps). The bulk of it is much better known around here as the “Pemi Loop”, as it’s part of a famous loop through the Pemigewasset Wilderness. It’s a weird mix of remote af and very popular with hikers https://t.co/wx1MIEBY6E I told my neighbors that I was having a Fourth of July party on the roof that was catered by Kelly’s roast beef just wait till they go up there and see that nobody’s up there and the joke will be on them. Hello friends, would you like to come on a journey with us? (🧵🪡) https://t.co/Qh2rOCZbzL No celebrations, only me repping @imirregulargirl on a JetBlue Flight. 🧚🏻‍♀️⚔️💖 https://t.co/i5Jq1fotXC Ever go over to turn on a fan you have not used in a while and it blasts dust and pollen into your face as soon as you turned it on?

But do you think Trump and/or his closest cohorts will ever see justice for their crimes? Thank you to the amazing staff and board at @reproequity_now who have been fighting tirelessly to preserve and advance reproductive rights in Massachusetts. #mapoli https://t.co/YQ8XHLQsVy It says a lot about @ewarren that she took the time to come kick off a canvass supporting the Fair Share Amendment. There’s no doubt she knows it will raise billions for transportation and education without costing over 99% of MA residents a single penny #FairShareMA #mapoli https://t.co/bCJ8J6QfqG never posting about needing an apartment again https://t.co/eh0TeHGb1Y LOL.

Ready to unlock the full potential of my cerebellum with @therealjoebob and @kinky_horror at @thecoolidge. https://t.co/nj54tVWd2O The bill takes enormous steps to:

➡️Break down cost barriers to accessing abortion care
➡️Close a statutory loophole to ensure no one is forced to travel out of state for care
➡️Simplify access to emergency contraception We are thrilled that the House is moving on a package to expand abortion access!

The House bill would break down barriers to abortion access and protect our Massachusetts providers who offer critical abortion and gender affirming care. ⬇️ honestly this is how it feels to be in grad school. https://t.co/AQBJgyFCOu [PT.1] The second day of the ICGS Global Forum III is done and dusted!

Didn’t think I still had the capacity to be surprised. Where was this sticker when I was married. https://t.co/cKhJsYUs35 Takeaways from todays Jan 6 hearings:

Trump is psychotic.  

They wanted violence.  

They were openly trying to undo the will of the voters.  

They knew they were armed.  

Don’t say this lightly - Trump should be arrested by this weekend.  He won’t be, but God should he be. This will win prizes. A phrase I hear not infrequently. And some fields have so very many prizes that practically every book wins a prize. And then we can call it a prize-winning book written by an award-winning author. @Endthemisery1 At this moment, the bravest woman in America.  May she stay safe 🙏 Therapy isn’t enough.

He spent much of his teen years in a British jail in Comilla for agitating against imperial rule.

2022-07-19,"Sunset in Cambridge. https://t.co/1ehLUeOXP4 Here’s a web archive of an article I wrote about it for The Ride Magazine in the fall of 1993:

https://t.co/xfqxhBX7uZ I did learn never to split a train, though, and Mike McCarthy taught me that. Still, I didn’t think we’d still be “teaching” this way 30ish years later. I thought it ended with my generation and GoPros, as I noted in the @CriteriumNation podcast today. I was laughably wrong. I did one cool down lap, rode to his team van where he was, put my bike down, and punched him in the face. We brawled and bystanders separated us. The day I learned never to split a leadout train was when Radisa Cubric was on Mengoni and being lead out by his team and Mike McCarthy at the Mengoni GP, and I had Mike’s wheel. Radisa hip slung off me and launched me backwards w 200 meters to go, and I came back and won. This was an all out dermato-phyte #dermtwitter #derm Go get ‘em Marcus. This review is going to change the game y’all. Please read it! Just listened to this vinyl beauty in our room at The Verb in Boston. This side, back to back. Reminded me that, imo, Top 10 sides ever.

Net export denialism! One thing that 99% of college athletes could improve upon in this new era of NIL: strategy

Far too many athletes are hyper-focused on the short-term benefit of partnering with brands ($ or product), rather than how partnerships can lead to long-term growth for the athlete.

We will be announcing the winners at our LIVE SHOW this Friday night. https://t.co/fZyjTsYOjn @CooperVazao @LittleKeegs0 @cIubmoss Does it? Wonderful news! Congratulations to @DanielSolove and @hartzog. Can’t wait to get a copy of my own. I’m genuinely really angry about this. I’ve been a lifelong fan of baseball it’s been my heart and soul and to see how the MLB owners have negotiated in bad faith with the players has left a horrific taste in my mouth. This is truly a shame and horrific day for baseball. In the US 🇺🇸 for a couple of weeks, where it turns out it’s much colder than the UK…

HMU if you’re in East Coast/Bay Area. 

#ShouldHavePackedABiggerCoat https://t.co/rGktqvjlEm Truly very angry with Major League Baseball &amp; the MLB Owner with how this lockout has transpired and the lack of goodwill to negotiate in good faith with the MLBPA https://t.co/jmHwzVrXgE @thetirekinge @vexas_vixen @Tosci_Marie Except Beyonce loves her blonde hair and that's not natural to India and Peru.

#NHLJets Pierre-Luc Dubois on hitting Charlie Coyle through a pane of glass.

Says he’s glad everyone OK. And that it would have felt better if they won the game. Lucky 13 x 100% beautician. I’m putting $130 on the board for the judge tonight @fratkin13 @heroshockey https://t.co/BXslhpl1kr @SocDoneLeft Wow, unfollowing now.

I was a big fan of their efforts to make unemployment insurance accessible for gig workers. Didn't realize they were also negging women. Just atrocious power play work there by the #NHLJets, and it costs them at least a point. 3-2 loss is official. Brad Marchand just got bodychecked by a ghost, it appears.

Either that, or there was a real-life video game glitch there. #NHLJets, down 3-2, get two straight power plays, get outshot 2-0 with the extra man during those four minutes.

Woof. Cold and beautiful. https://t.co/AQhpkVMZzl David Pastrnak gives Boston the lead with his 19th goal of the season.

I'll show myself out, folks. Pierre-Luc Dubois just bodychecked Charlie Coyle right through a pane of glass.

Unreal. 

Huge reaction from the crowd as that happened. 

What a horse PLD is. Just snapped this selfie &amp; idgaf I'm flexin, lol... Its OK to big yourself up sometimes peeps. See ya soon CT, First stop my Mommy 😍, then #djing at Stella Blues in New Haven. I'll be dropping some luscious #housemusic tonight so roll thru! May you all have a great night. ❤️🔥💪 https://t.co/Z0QucYZv7R Cole Perfetti is so, so smart. Just makes a subtle line spin on the zone entry there to calmly keep possession for his club. BREAKING - RAW VIDEO, LANGUAGE WARNING: Police responding to a confirmed shooting at South Shore Plaza in #Braintree Massachusetts. People evacuating. No word on if anyone is in custody. #wcvb https://t.co/7dIFaKnrrW Feeling lonely sucks. It's been a great Saturday for Charlie Coyle. He now has a goal and an assist today.

I shook Speaking up for H.4045, the #UtilityRelief4All bill, alongside my colleagues @Rep_Erika and @VoteSteveOwens with @GridTakers this afternoon. We should cancel utility debt and insist on public ownership of public utilities as the way to best achieve economic and climate justice. https://t.co/wl5G7XuvsM I know Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting, but I guess Saturday afternoon is, too? Second scrap of the first period. six starbucks locations unionizing within a mile of me 💅 fine fine so why do you have Boston in your profile “2nd fastest time in program history”… casual. Way to go JJ ! @iccyjay3 What a pass by Dylan Samberg to spring Kyle Connor on a breakaway, but his shot goes wide. Seconds later, Cole Perfetti seems to have an open net to shoot at, but his shot hits a Bruins defender.

Nice shift for the two young 'uns there. @AlexPetrovnia But I don't think either one really by itself amounts to a monolithic ""biological sex"". I think the current understanding of sex is that it's very multifactorial.

So I think the term is fundamentally bogus. If you follow me religiously -- and why the hell would you?! -- you'll note I tweet PLD ""making friends again"" pretty much every #NHLJets game now. He is a wrecking ball on skates, full of P+V who must not be very fun to play against, I'd imagine. @AlexPetrovnia The way they use the term, they should probably be saying genital type, or if they are really interested in seeming sciency, they could talk about karyotype (chromosomes). The iPad MVP 😂 #RetroComputing https://t.co/6U0UklWCwV Jansen Harkins is 2/3 of the way to the Gordie Howe hat trick. Got the goal out of the way, now gets the fight out of the way. Just needs an assist. MARCHAND LOOKING GOOD ON HIS FIRST SHIFT #NHLBruins https://t.co/k7OD0CQuXo Seeing some ""HOW CAN THEY SCRATCH SVECHNIKOV"" angst out there. Important to remember he's been battling an injury, and I don't believe he's 100 per cent healthy. So I wouldn't be so quick to put him down as a ""healthy scratch."" Wanna head down to a game together @Jared_Carrabis ? I’m incredibly excited to announce my first illustrated children’s book, #ProGamersGuide to Healthy Habits, in collaboration with @BricksOBrian! But we still need your help bringing this idea to reality, would you please visit our kickstarter campaign? https://t.co/RsJCMGlZIx https://t.co/EiWrKcx4d5 Another awesome day for #Hollistontrack. 4x800-first place. Breaks school record and punches ticket to Nationals. DMR- first place, narrowly missing national qualifying standard. Shot put relay- 4th place. SMR- 5th place. Long jump relay and 4x200- 7th place finish. @MSTCA1 🥇🥇 https://t.co/ymiov7zrFI #NHLJets Dave Lowry says he's willing to give players a chance to earn spots/play elevated roles. He sure looks to be backing up those words with actions.

Perfetti still in high-profile spot. Samberg stays in lineup. Nothing permanent, of course. But good chance for the ""kids."" #NHLBruins Brad Marchand on the ice for warmups vs #GoJetsGo https://t.co/EsAVEzJgaS Downtown Turkey Crossing 🦃 https://t.co/5XIwilem54 #NHLJets line rushes, D pairs here in Boston:

Take your time...😋 https://t.co/CvJTzUAomW Ducks on ice!! https://t.co/J2L9pVWIoP It's a fair argument to ask why we need a vaccine mandate now, just as our omicron wave is subsiding. I'd argue it's just as important now if not more so as people start to get out more, especially in these first few weeks. It's a crazy world where I embrace Brookline as a fellow traveler but start having doubts about Cambridge and Somerville, I know Somerville is a great place and for a lot of discussions it's firmly urban, but passing on a vaccine mandate at this point in time reveals some latent suburban mentality. I just won't eat-in in the suburbs right now. Maybe in a month. I made my tiktaalik drawing into a sticker! Want one?

Drying my laundry, cleaned up my apartment, more work to be done at 4pm, then heading to the #NHLBruins game tonight vs #GoBolts The Power of Present: A National Summit on Student Absenteeism is in full effect!

how are we repairing the harm caused by this today? what lessons did we take from this? it's our job as educators, planners + community members to answer these questions. the future of Boston depends on it. @LauraAlix @HeyRatty Could do a lot by just saying “local access only” to the north end. Most of the traffic on Hanover and Newbury is circling for a space or showing their sound system. If you don’t live there park somewhere else. No Ubers etc either. Unless necessary for anyone disabled. One of the easiest things most #humans could do to decrease their #ecological #footprint and help mitigate #climatechange is to eat less #meat. https://t.co/UrwrX6bmOX So much joy.

My response is studied silence, a low voice, and an inscrutable face. It is a type of self-defense that comes with a high price tag. #MadeleineAlbright was an inspiration and role model to women, Americans, and believers in democracy everywhere. Her public service and commitment to diplomacy and human rights exemplifies how hard work and belief in our common good can overcome fear and division.

Hockey has proven yet again that talent always prevail no matter how dark and morbid of a past you have.
#GoHabsGo Logan Mailloux and Mitchell Miller are just two recent examples to prove exactly that.
Which makes the #NHLBruins decision to sign Miller even more maddening she brought me a shallot :') https://t.co/R1OJVkhkhh Really loving #USIH2022. And like any responsible academic, I’m taking advantage of the chance to see Boston’s local sites. https://t.co/pLbp3m0Nzz Fri

Great job of reporting by @wbz @PaulaEbben on the Mitchell Miller story What #NHLBruins prospect Mitchell Miller did WAS NOT A MISTAKE!
You don’t go and ABUSE another human being for 6 years and call that a MISTAKE! https://t.co/S9Xi5CmeXH The ongoing narrative @elonmusk is ignoring is that his behavior and decisions are leading to brand instability.

Worth it https://t.co/PKXTANLvrr Are you serious? Do you not understand the seriousness of what Miller did? It ain’t about when it happened there are certain actions that you don’t dare give rewards or privileges for this is one of them. If that was your son or daughter abused by Miller how would you feel? For you sick bastards out there who are saying “he was a kid when it happened”,
If that was your son or daughter that was a victim of bullying and abuse how would you feel? Honestly I can’t believe the shit I’m seeing on here in terms of the #NHLBruins signing Mitchell Miller I hope so, it wouldn’t surprise me if Patrice Bergeron does that at some point #NHLBruins Playing in the NHL is a privilege, not a right. Playing for the Boston Bruins is a privilege that oh so few have. Rewarding someone who abused a classmate is not okay and to even use that as “why can’t he be a part of society” is sickening! He can be a part of society not the NHL I’m still really angry post recording of the video on the #NHLBruins signing Mitchell Miller.
Like what could possibly go through management’s collective skulls to think that signing a racist, a bully, someone who was involved in such a heinous act would be okay with the Bruins?! Fresh Kermit and safer crossing distances in Garden Street https://t.co/OisY3mk9kl Angry doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel about the #NHLBruins signing defenseman Mitchell Miller.
No, he does not deserve a second change in the NHL, or with the Boston Bruins for the fact of the matter. https://t.co/6vWZq9P7oh @JahlilMalik_ @raphousetv2 Jasmin got a gun Mobility-based walkability (GPS; 10-minute-level exposure assessment) and physical activity (@Fitabase; minute-level exposure assessment) are associated — beautiful presentation by @WiltGrete ! ⌚️❤️🚶🏾‍♀️🏁 https://t.co/7b6AaMpynK Just a couple of antler boys hangin out for this #FursuitsFriday 🦌

It’s actually one of my biggest fears. I hope I’m never with someone who is manipulative and/or abusive. People always speculate but I know surviving a violent relationship isn’t easy and warnings are missed Compromise isn’t about completely ignoring your needs and forfeiting autonomy. You should still be able to show up for yourself in a relationship. Manipulative people will blur those lines and gaslight you Both women and men play into the “you’ll never find a man if ____” hysteria 

So many people putting up with problematic and abusive behavior out of fear of being alone. Being single and sustainable is much better than being in a co-dependent toxic relationship Bruce Cassidy on what it says about the character shown by his team without McAvoy and Lindholm Sunday.

Buccaneers QB Tom Brady asked about parity in the league (30 of 32 teams are 3-1, 2-2 or 1-3): “I think there’s a lot of bad football, from what I watch. I’ve watched a lot of bad football.

THIS We have a lot of work to do in Boston. There’s no denying that.

But people from all across the country, those within the federal government, all tell me how they view us as the beacon of hope.

There’s no doubt that we have the ability, potential, and vision to change the world. “I sign Xander Bogaerts and I don’t extend Rafael Devers”

Am I the only person who is way more comfortable in separated bicycle lanes than on neighborhood greenways? Montgomery said there’s no timeline yet on Grzelcyk/Hall - but he added that Grzelcyk should be cleared for a full-contact sweater soon. Montgomery on Studnicka: “He’s earned the right to continue to be here.” Marc McLaughlin was indeed cut by the Bruins and sent Providence: “He had a great camp.” Jim Montgomery said physicality and some of his details are things to work on while readying for his next NHL shot Montgomery notes that McLaughlin has “had a great camp,” but they want him to continue to work on his details down in Providence. Have to imagine he’ll earn plenty of top-six minutes down there to start. Bruins announce nine cuts to the training camp roster.

McLaughlin, Beecher, Ahcan, Lysell, Keyser to Providence.

Koppanen, Kinkaid, Lettieri and Renouf on waivers. Naaaah maybe I'm cynical but in practice, the push for ""entrepreneurship"", ""investment"" and ""generational wealth"" in the black community is essentially a push to get black people's dollars into the formal banking system aka into the hands of people who mean them the most harm Inasmuch as we have a national freight policy, it is pro-trucking and anti-rail. Not that we do hugely well by actual truckers either. Converting NY-17 to I-86 is far from the worst highway project out there, but notice how easy the money is to get when there's a perfectly available and underutilized parallel freight rail line. Happening now.

There’s power in knowing that you aren’t the only one and that if you are considering becoming a marketer, developer, or architect, you have examples in front of you who have paved the way, who have done the work That was my experience 15 years ago, but it's also still my reality now. There’s nothing like being in a room and listening to people that look like you. Rubbing elbows with other professionals of color, then walking away with the tools and connections you need to survive… ✨ About 15 years ago, I attended a conference with about 5k people. I recall walking around the conference center and not seeing anyone that looked like me presenting or attending.

@BIDMCRad @BIDMC_AbdImg For the record, I've given talks at Yale Law School in that exact room and I didn't need armed private security. I also wasn't protested. Almost like if you don't promote hate, you won't get protested, it's that simple! https://t.co/1MwnUi6HyG The students left at the beginning of the panel and the panelists were able to continue their presentation. There was no disruption. Even if there was, I think it was warranted. LGBTQ activism is rooted in making those in power uncomfortable. Think ACT UP disrupting mass. Harrison just walked in and said “what’s up with Fleetwood Mac? Tell me about that.” I have cleared my schedule for the afternoon. Your patients can do more than they think. All day long I am pushing my patients to do more and they are always surprised by the outcome. Lift more, push more and move more. It’s all relative but you’d be surprised how much it helps them! https://t.co/85ORX53eWW The right wing disinformation machine is already in gear.

That means each restaurant participating in the outdoor dining program FOR 5 months will pay at least $15,000.  

SHAME ON YOU, @wutrain! I will bet my life the North End outdoor dining program brings more business to the CITY OF BOSTON than any other neighborhood. With that being said, charging us, the only neighborhood, a $7,500 fee, is highway robbery. The city should be ashamed of themselves.

*Crowd goes wild* https://t.co/WhK9xM50dg So unfortunately I won't be at tonight's BU-UVM game. It'll be the first time I've missed a home game for @TerrierHockey. But I do have a good reason! Listening to slipknot’s eponymous self titled album “Slipknot” a concept album about having a great time No shot. Pitchers are way too good and organizations incentivize the home run so much that players focus more on power. @ChrisCotillo Sounds like a choice, what am I missing? @chillincharlieX @OccupyDemocrats This woman, Amelia King, who works for Ruffner Family Dentistry in Luray, VA.

In other news, it was so cold at shootaround that most players wore stocking caps during the walkthrough. Straight men, has your PCP ever discussed PrEP with you? I’ve been taking Truvada for about 6 years. I talk about it casually, but  it’s usually only queer folks or allies who know what I’m talking about 

Same people talking about promiscuity and public health don’t even know what preventative measures exist A couple months ago we tweaked our #vegan chicken recipe. It’s got just the right “chew”, it’s flaky and it tastes cluckin’ great. Best thing about it? We make it right here and can pronounce every ingredient. https://t.co/d00YiDh5c3 @OgLakyn I’m really interested in exploring this lack of access and stigma surrounding it. It feels homophobic to me CAIR is a terrorist organization. Period. Is Truvada/Descovy marketed to anyone besides gay men?

I’ve spoken to several straight men who didn’t know PrEP existed 

Is there a PrEP option for women? We prevented a second Great Depression. The inflation is worth it. The Oar is opening at the end of February in Mr. Dooley’s spot.

    🫦 @jamie_weisman My daughter flies for work a few times a month, never got Covid. Last flight, she is seated next to an unmasked woman who coughed the entire 3 hour flight. Came home and has been really sick with Covid for 10 days.  The woman was clearly sick and chose not to wear a mask. Watching folks doubt my ability to be as good (if not better) a business woman as I am an artist is mind-blowing. As if having care for both isn’t the reason they know the music in the first place. 🤷🏾‍♀️ White people are always “offended” when racism and bias is called out. Save the fucking tears, you’re not being oppressed. Marginalized folks speaking on their experiences doesn’t yield any tangible consequences other than discomfort My therapist graduated me to monthly check ins but we’re going to take the summer off and transition to as needed sessions. I’m so happy for the work we’ve done and the tools she’s provided for me. I LOVE YOU #WESTIE

A lot of people don’t believe me that disabled people can get paid less than minimum wage just look up subminimum wage for people with disabilities. #LaborDay do not call me a party girl i will kill my self LeBron….talk like my uncle lmaoo This may *feel* like a choice between rape culture or cop culture now...but what choice can we live with for four years?

Remember on Labor Day that in the United States companies are allowed to pay people with disabilities less than minimum wage because they are disabled. #LaborDay did south boston just tweet this PSA : Don't feel guilty about not sharing restaurants , shopping spots, personal scents etc. with people. It's ok to have some things you like to keep personal + private.

If you stand in the middle of the pitch and face the center of one goal and do a 180 you don’t end up in the middle of the other goal. Pitch is a joke. First harvest from my garden.

Food For Thought: 
• Terrible Game from Andrew Farrell
• MLS Refs are bad
• Petrovic is that guy. He probably won’t be here in 2 years. 🤷🏻‍♂️
• Kessler looked good for his 2nd match back (first 90 mins)
• Bou on🔥

Needs:
• 100% a Center-back

absolutely amazing how airline π-maximizing strategies have basically replicated the medieval nobility hierarchies, with dukes boarding before earls, an earl before a baron, then gentry, then yobs like myself @Saadia___M What christians believe and what their book teaches are unrelated.

#LevelUp https://t.co/DH07lyNYib Nevermind the whole thing about how for most of history mobility has been, and often still is, more an indicator of social vulnerability than of privilege. going to staples to print off my 50 favourite kevin durant tweets for an art project @rulib Are you suggesting that Americans be legally restricted from moving around? Two immutable principles:
1) You cannot freeze a place in amber 
2) You cannot force something positive (fixing injustice) to happen by saying no to everything

Anyone who tells you these things are possible is taking advantage of you and does not care about your interests. Honored and humbled to serve… Literally the last thing that it's good for vulnerable populations to do is promote this kind of ideology. The chances of it working the way folks think is approximately 0. Some of the responses to this are really unbelievable. I don't care who you are or how much life+government has screwed you, trying to turn other people into 2nd-class citizens is fundamentally reactionary and never an acceptable response. It should have no place in our politics. Happy #EmployeeAppreciationWeek! Outside of work, traveling is my passion!

Led by rad onc resident ⭐️⭐️ Dr. Laura Burgess Nice Captain America mask there 🇺🇸 We’ll have Boston Bruins players speaking all afternoon at Breakup Day here at Warrior. Bruce Cassidy is scheduled to speak tomorrow morning and Don Sweeney will address the media on Wednesday. TBA for Cam Neely, but it may be on Thursday I am sharing my work space right now with a dog in our shelter. I just burped and said “excuse me” to the dog. Then I laughed and the dog just tilted his head at me… @Ballislife @GetUpESPN @patbev21 bruh got serious hate in his veins for @CP3. No way @stephenasmith &amp; @jj_redick shouldn’t be destroying him trying to discredit CP3’s legacy like he’s average. CP3 has undoubtedly has been he key in resurrecting NBA teams. Pat Bev can’t say he’s done that but hating more people need to break up Chris Wagner said it was obviously challenging to be in the AHL all season, but part of him enjoyed being a bit of a player/coach mentor on the ice for the young P-Bruins guys: “It felt like I was in player development…kinda like Reg Dunlop” Sure sounds like pending UFA Anton Blidh is not going to be back after landing in the doghouse toward the end of the Bruins season: “Some days were harder than others. I did not sign here to sit on the 9th floor in the press box.” I emailed him a new draft yesterday and haven’t heard anything so when I turn this in, I’m sending the professor an email explaining that I’ve done 100% of the work since late April with screenshots of all the times I tried to get in touch with my partner bc this is unacceptable Winners Circle T Shirt arrived !
