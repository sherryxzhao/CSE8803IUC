1. My co-worker checked in to see if I took a break yet. (I have not)
2. One of my best friends let me know that I hurt her feelings. Allowing her to speak her truth and for me to grow. 

Idk why, but this feels like love. I feel like when white folks voice their frustrations with America as a country - they don’t get told “then leave/go somewhere else” NEARLY as much as Black and Brown folks do when we point out the flaws of this country.

Small crowd had gathered, some dudes were stoked and applauding, funny moment… Glad it went alright. was soon surrounded by life guard trucks and LAPD dune buggies

they said to let him go and an officer cuffed him. 

Dudes only took my shoes 😂 nothing else. Figure-four leg lock around his arms/body to restrain any arm movement 

Sunk in rear naked choke around his throat Guy began to tire out and slow down, as most men would

noticing this, my killer instinct kicked in

Accelerated like a leopard and leaped 

wrapped my arm around his neck and slammed him to the sand his other hand was checking his pocket. I figured he had my gopro/phone in there, sorta concerned he had a knife in pocket Dude had my shoes in one hand

I dig my shoes, they’re great kicks. @_Ryan_Griggs has worn them, he can confirm - a solid pair. 

I wasn’t about to let this fucker steal em. Running across the loose sand, gaining ground, heart bumping, adrenaline pumping he took off running and had about 30-40 yards on me as i breached land was swimming in Ocean

Comedy club 😂 While hiding from Raven &amp; the CIA (blonde era begins!), Moira sees a presentation by tech giant Arnab Chakladar, who is developing *human* technology not unlike Cerebro and Krakoan resurrection. He is on the precipice of creating homo novissima as described in HoXPoX. #xspoilers https://t.co/WaOycWbiDH As a parent of a pre-teen, I’m less concerned about hook up culture and more concerned about hook it up culture. Hook up culture celebrates connectionless relations while hook it up culture celebrates risking your job at McDonalds to hook up your neighbor with some extra fries. PROD SQUAD has LANDED! https://t.co/EcoNsXrPWm Moira blames C&amp;E for failing to protect her. Then she coughs. It’s important that the cancer, so far as Moira can tell, is new — she hasn’t had symptoms until now. Per Jane Foster, it has already progressed to stage four. #xspoilers https://t.co/e4WPT3Ye1m Best non-Disney hotel to stay at walking distance to the park entrance and why @BonGucci don’t call yourself a Ye stan and then disrespect X like this.

I have an 18-year-old daughter who drives and doesn’t live at home with me. I have 135 clients that could have an emergency. I leave my phone on at night.  If you text me between the hours of 11 PM and 8 AM and it’s not an emergency you’re rude! What is Doug up to? Pure speculation, but my current theory is he has a plan not unlike Moira’s —  but one that doesn’t require mutants to forsake mutantdom. He’s slowly building a mutant Dominion using Warlock — a mutant Technarch cut off from the hive. #xspoilers When they move to kill her, Doug interrupts. In this issue we have learned that Doug and Warlock are doing even more Weird Phalanx Stuff with the island than we knew about. Doug is able to convince them to free Moira — at least for now. #xspoilers https://t.co/k60F1FvJ7V I’m a Black revolutionary, not a white far left activist @Justin_G0rd0n

We will fight this fight together 

🖤 Irene, now aware of Life III and extrapolating Moira kept her dead in order to pursue the cure in Life X, kidnaps Moira. She and Raven insult her pretensions of godhood and cut out the tracker to hide her from Charles and Erik — whom they trick intro attacking Orchis. #xspoilers https://t.co/pvemslRrwp Congratulations to our @EdgewoodBBB team for making it to the semi finals! Your sportsmanship, competitive nature, and love of the game is to be be commended. Thank you students and families for coming out to support our players❤️. https://t.co/MpREnWOy3U I’m so deep in the NFT game I just called a restaurant and asked them for WL instead of a reservation 😂 What has changed? Karima creating Orchis and accelerating the machine timeline, which compelled Moira to believe Life X was in a failure state. She *then* began pursuing the cure plan, necessitating keeping Irene dead. She believed Charles and Erik had fucked it up. #xspoilers I reactivated my TikTok account so I could do these dumbass audios. Sksks Finding I need to schedule time to “prepare myself to work on novel revisions” and then also add the time to actually work on novel revisions. #amwriting https://t.co/Fmx2OaHUDu Here’s the critical moment in terms of “was Moira against us all along”, I think: Karima tells us that the mutants of Krakoa destroyed the Dominions and ended the Phalanx forever. In timeline 10a, Moira facilitated that. She remained loyal to her original Life X plan. #xspoilers https://t.co/00qVZx3p9b What a wild way to see out my last week at the #genesisinvitational at Riv. 90 degrees then hail. Couldn’t be more grateful for my time here and the mentorship. Looking forward to my next adventure joining @CalClimbingSoup at Cal Club. https://t.co/elzUzOTDWH Emma immediately flips on them and goes to Raven and Irene. Crucially, we then learn that Charles, Erik, and Moira lied to her, saying “we always win” rather than lose — and she didn’t buy any of it. #xspoilers https://t.co/AN6vlPTLKV We’re having a great talk about fascism, reproductive rights, transkids, THE WICKER MAN, MIDSOMMAR, music, psychology, Hot Topic… in short, we’re having a wonderful time. Emma plays it cool, but immediately sees through Moira’s bullshit in a way that Charles and Erik don’t. Because Emma IS a pragmatist, Moira does now believe Emma will help them. #xspoilers https://t.co/AGGhwWo70L When Raven brings Irene back, and Emma votes to seat her on the QC, Moira is driven to violent rage. C&amp;E convince her they need to bring Emma into their circle. Erik makes it clear to Moira he will never pragmatically sacrifice Krakoa (or mutation). #xspoilers https://t.co/c9BvAboUVw Britney suffered in silence for 13 years!

#LAGalaxy https://t.co/WMF3ESqoPl Fully disgusted with C&amp;E, Moira NOW begins implementing her back-up “long-term strategy”: resynthesize the ‘cure’, survive long enough to implement it, and make mutants and humans merge with the Phalanx. Peace. Forever.

To do this she needs Irene dead permanently. #xspoilers https://t.co/2ok3rZs4Jy Everyone getting mad at me for pointing out that Texas has cheap housing should really save their rage for the fact that California housing policies are basically forcing hundreds of thousands of people to move there.

Either way, Im so glad I saw this in person. #GoldenGirls https://t.co/MwbbBz0Ad1 Erik and Charles admit that the very day they established the Quiet Council — a government body that excludes Moira — and locked her away beneath the island, they placed a tracker inside her without her knowledge.

Due to hard work, passion, and lots of luck I achieved my dream at Lucasfilm.

Lonnie Walker (at MLE): C-

Don’t trust him. Reject him.

And he’s blaming “advocates” for Democratic losses. https://t.co/LKFxS43Q08 Almost all the guys he backed… lost. (Giggle) A jaw dropping, heart shattering listen Based on Biden’s approval rating &amp; historical midterm trends, Democrats bucked all presumed odds of a GOP shellacking. 

Ultimately, we owe our historically anomalous results to two words. 

“Trump” and “Dobbs.” I understand why everyone’s upgrading twitter but holy shit seeing all these check marks is fucking confusing lmao Bail reform means: 1000s free from cruel &amp; dangerous conditions in NYC jails. Millions of taxpayer dollars saved. And yet: Adams still wants to funnel that money into a bloated NYPD budget &amp; spreading lies to make it happen. 

This is Mayor's ""groundwork"" to ""end homelessness."" https://t.co/SVRVWUtI26 And as a Latina there’s so much anti black in Latin culture even anti indigenous, I see so many people claiming black &amp; brown pride just to still sit around and talk about black and indigenous people.

This is something else. https://t.co/AkpgGVzZhd Remember when Issa wrote something joking abt Black women and Asian men needing to link because nobody likes us and y’all got mad? The decisions that are being made in newsrooms about how to report stories around crime and justice are not neutral in impact. Please look at this chart and read this thread from how politicians like Eric Adams uses the press to change public perception. https://t.co/8mlLZ3hbZN By scaring &amp; scapegoating the people and communities he is supposed to be serving, Adams continues to oversee the incarceration of nearly 6000 people in deadly conditions in city jails, while still calling for the incarceration of thousands more. https://t.co/VPcSMhDzli I would love to see Megan Markle on Caresha Please Fan art is awesome. My 1st official makeup appointment is tomorrow ahhhh 🥳🥳🥳 @jeffreyhoward33@mastodon.social just in case! Not going anywhere though. Already buying cozy winter pajamas 🤭.

At a pivotal moment in the campaign he leaned into join Trump supporter Lee Zeldin's bail circus. Where he lied to blame bail reform. https://t.co/gVinckdr5P Looks like I’ll be in Chicago for two weeks!! Let’s have fun and go crazy @AERA_EdResearch @NARSTorg Why are there so many tweets about everyone needing to check on Mark? Is he okay and why does he need $8? NYC Mayor Eric Adams is closely aligned w/ Lee Zeldin. GOP candidate for Governor of New York. Trump supporter. Election fraud liar. January 6 inciter. This is how bad NYC Mayor Eric Adams is. Why are we still listening to him? Treating him seriously? https://t.co/XN6NRzb11C A League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and A Goddess of Love. 🦅❤️‍🔥⚔️
#GodofWarRagnarok ❄️💙 #Freya https://t.co/ZuWBVh0CD2 In NYC Mayor Eric Adams’s New York, you get cops &amp; handcuffs instead of lifeguards. What an extraordinarily violent waste of taxpayer money. And unnecessary criminalization. https://t.co/3YyFh3Lv6V Super stoked to be one of 5 featured artists donating 95% of my profit from a 1/1 piece I created exclusively for Art Basel Women’s Rights Charity Event in Miami 2022. Stay tuned! 👇🏻Thank you Universe for the ability to create and share the love with other humans on Earth! ☝🏻🌌🤍 Under Eric Adams arrests for jumping subway turnstiles (inability to afford public transportation) increased by more than 100% (!!!) year-over-year, according to data from the New York Division of Criminal Justice Services and Police Reform Organizing Project. https://t.co/c465yLUyff Just got a massage for the first time in my 29 years of life because my bosses got us vouchers for the holidays and yeah okay I Get It Super excited to be in Jakarta next month for @DWPfest wit the fam @BARONG_FAMILY 😍😍😍 https://t.co/idqDqa9Qps Under NYC Mayor Eric Adams, arrests of Black and brown New Yorkers for low level offenses have skyrocketed. He’s worse than Rudy Giuliani. Watch carceral, cruel, &amp; spiteful NYC Mayor Eric Adams smile &amp; laugh when asked why 2000 more people are caged pretrial on Rikers than required for the city’s plan to close Rikers. 

Then rhetorically asks: “Tell us. What do we do w/ those inmates?” https://t.co/R7z5JWEswt The Peter Principle states that employees are promoted based until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent.

The Musk Principle states that bosses self-promote until they reach a level where it becomes undeniable that they are no longer competent. Query: Why is NYC Mayor Eric Adams fighting to kill bail reform &amp; cage thousands more when *all data now unanimously confirms* that bail reform &amp; decarceration have saved taxpayers hundreds of millions, helped keep people working &amp; in their homes, w/ no negative impact on crime? https://t.co/wFNta4WW8Q What’s better than sex?….pasta obviously.

They are especially disgusting when they happen in Los Angeles.
 
This is not how a real Democrat or a real Angeleno campaigns.
 
@RickCarusoLA should be ashamed. https://t.co/cPBCsCcpkP Here is how Rick Caruso’s fellow billionaire Kelly Loeffler depicted Karen Bass’ congressional colleague Raphael Warnock in a similar attack ad: https://t.co/BCuNza8gy7 McCain against Obama
Loeffler against Warnock
Graham against Harrison
Caruso against Bass
 
This is what Republicans do when they run against Black leaders.
 
This wasn’t put out by a PAC. The Caruso camp is stoking racial fears by airing ads that artificially darken Bass' face. https://t.co/EesTU8Z3xM Love you all. x

We love you LA ❤️ https://t.co/0aA24DIUJQ Went to lunch with a friend who makes whiskey and ran into a friend who’s an investor in a tequila. Afternoon productivity 📉 And when your moment comes to do what you’ve always wanted to do, CRUSH IT! Before we wrote Detective Pikachu, most people in the business would not have thought us capable of writing such a thing. We had to prove and put ourselves in a position to prove it! You can too! https://t.co/T0d4wvkoix How you do this can be strategic! Write samples that bridge the gap between what you’ve done and what you want, ask your reps to look for shows that further your goals, like we did with The Tick. Suddenly, to the industry, we could write superheroes (our ability never changed!) Only you know what you are capable of writing. You might start out doing something completely different, like we did with a family sitcom, when in your heart you want to write fantasy. Execs tend to put writers in a box, so it’s up to you to challenge their idea of your writing! Every day it’s a battle.

But this book is gonna be so worth it.

Besides Twitter which is primarily “work” for me, I’m posting more there than any other friends/social focused app. Post at certain times, wherever you are, keep it real. It even gamifies posting things/people I normally wouldn’t. https://t.co/y2EtyWQdbA Been thinking recently, it doesn’t matter what others say-

One underappreciated aspect of the reason why we're seeing so many VR headsets and motion controls coming out is that the patents have expired. Same for 3D printing. Patents hold back technology by decades. First a motorcycle and now Roids! Wow. Just wow. What a moron. That long term deal is looking terrible right now. #padres #sameoldpadres I CAN’T even https://t.co/GwsppiGQ56 If I’m a Padres fan I’d be LIVID. So unacceptable. What a disaster that Tatis contract is and he was supposed to be the “face of baseball.” He’s been about as dependable CA gas prices. @KyleSamani One I’ve felt is that on Instagram, if you’re not posting, you disappear. You can’t have a positive experience on Instagram w/o creating.

TikTok users, on the other hand, can have a fulfilling consumer experience without ever needing to post a video. Comment section = community. “AAARGH” 🏴‍☠️

Stop telling women that lifting is unsafe or bad for their health. It is simply untrue. Unless you’re using steroids or other PEDs, your hormones will be perfectly fine, I promise. Stop spreading misinformation, women don’t just become roided-out rage beasts just because they picked up a dumbbell that weighed more than 5lbs. If anything, lifting improves your mood and makes you a happier/more pleasant person! a guy today was telling a woman that lifting weights would change her disposition and make her “aggro” instead of sweet so I’d like to remind everyone that no, that doesn’t happen just from lifting, and also I love kittens and the color pink and cry at Disney movies https://t.co/O92436YeNW Chilling with my new friends @coryvanlew and @andrevanlew

I won't saying the best Batman STORY, but Pattison is a great Dark Knight and Matt Reeves clearly understands who and what Batman is, and why he does what he does.

Calling it a horror movie is a bit strong, too. 

7/10; Highly recommend. But also, life shouldn’t end up imitating art like this. The bad guy shouldn’t be such a caricature that it’s comparable to kids films.

He was advised to counterbalance the fact that he mostly dates NON Black women.

Watched the evolution of his American rebranding w/ my own eyes &amp; it worked on y’all I guess? 🤷🏾‍♀️ Just got back from the joke of a city council meeting. I’m still processing the ridiculousness of it all. she put my latex teddy in the washer/dryer goddamn @LucilleCroft this whole thread is 💯

i’ve completely rejected all that noise, even when knowing i lost gigs where my anti-sexy attire was held against me 😅

male djs can wear a black tee every gig and no one says shit, yet just as u said, we’re judged constantly Fuck this guy. In 2018 He got in our face after we asked him to step out of a private section that was set for an impacted family during their Angelversary. He made a scene and called us aggressive.  He has been trying to plant himself in impacted family circles for years. Real love won't quit on you. Feyd is the nephew of the Baron who’s played by Stellan Skarsgård in Dune and this could not be a better casting choice since Austin and the Skarsgård could DEFINITELY look like they’re all related.

I used to think “nah I shouldn’t spend money on myself. I’m not worth it. I’d rather save it or spend it on someone else”.

If your lawyer charges you 5% to look at your contract. Make sure you only pay them for the fee. If they try and get 5% for life on that agreement they are ripping you off! Trump falls back on his usual line to try and get out of trouble: “I didn’t know” Nick Fuentes. Shouldn’t a presidential candidate, or someone on his staff, Google the name of someone they agree to meet with? With Trump, it’s always incompetence and denial. https://t.co/2AQZvXyyie I ordered a fake-ass mini tree off of Amazon that allegedly will be arriving tomorrow; it’s my FIRST tree in my home.

That’s not how it works. The Proud Boys are free to spread their hate. But no newspaper is required to publish it.

me: https://t.co/Bdxu1n7VZq Real courage (in your career &amp; in life) is to stop blaming others and circumstances, and look inside. To discover where YOU went wrong. What you can fix. What you can make better. How you can grow. #Voiceover #VO #VoiceActing @SovasVoice @deltoroVoice @scOttsummitt @briangracevo ""elections aren't fair"" says the party in power The sudden collapse there coincides with John Dean’s testimony with 85,000,000 people watching on tv and the immediate aftermath of it.

And its slightly albliest This is the exact argument that zoning reframers often made in the 1910s, they pointed to extreme and rare edge cases -- e.g. slaughterhouses near residences -- and then proceded recast poor households as a nuisance and use the resulting system to enforce class-based segregation.

Essentially, if you think of something you need to do or tell someone announce it “18 second rule” and get it done within that time and you’ll never forget it down the road. The government should provide everyone with free masks during a pandemic. My new morning alarm created by Intak.

I heard there was a fight during Sara Landry at exchange LA this past weekend. I saw a fight during her set in San Diego. Sara Landry is certified fight techno More of @KateCagle is a win for L.A. every time i fly i am forced to confront the memory of the time i accidentally dosed myself w/ acid while i was taking some pre-flight mushrooms Somewhat amusing, because anyone can read this thread and clearly see that I never said there were six PIOs in the courtroom. I said there were six total in the office and one or two in the courtroom. Be sure to get your facts straight, @LASuperiorCourt. Imagine how different the past 3 years would have been with Dr. Ladapo at the helm instead of Fauci, Birx, Walensky &amp; the rest of the #CovidGrifters? Kids wouldn't have been forced to get sh0ts, for one thing. #DoNoHarm #AbolishAB2098 #DeSantis2024 For what? I did. The court’s “public information office” is reading my tweets, but not very closely because one of them just “corrected” me to say there aren’t six PIOs in the courtroom, only two.
“Be sure to get your facts right, Meghann.”
(Even though I never said six were in the courtroom.) Pelosi didn’t get 2 Billion from Saudi or make 650 million while working in the White House. Maxx Crosby IS the defense. Oh shit the DJ police are at the gate Picking 25 players for your World Cup roster when you are allowed 26, is so gnarly.

I also never imagined going to purchase a &gt;$100k vehicle and be treated worse than the DMV.

#RoeVsWade #AbortionIsHealthcare #Pediatrics #WomensRights https://t.co/aPLATZQmk7 America, you have gravely disappointed me. If anyone reading this is happy about todays Supreme Court ruling please unfollow me now. It’s time to codify Roe and preclude a National Abortion Ban.  It is literally now or never. Most federal mandates &amp; executive orders are abuses of top down controls. If you don’t think so, you might just be authoritarian. Don’t be shy! Many in the freest nation on earth are exhibiting authoritarian tendencies every time they FORCE people to do what they want. #liberty I thought the Supreme Court was supposed to protect us from a tyrannical minority.  Not be the tyrannical minority. The states have no authority over guns but complete authority over wombs. 

There, am I now inconsistent enough to be a Supreme Court justice? THEY DESERVE TO FEEL AS UNSAFE AS WE DO https://t.co/ve1vmujydQ I HATE WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO TALK TO ME LIKE I’M A NEW ARTIST I’VE BEEN IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY FOR MORE THAN 6 YEARS I used to be a devout Christian (was literally my mega church’s worship leader) and seeing my old community celebrate today’s decision is actually sickening. if you’re imposing your beliefs, you have no ethical mindfulness and are the reason we are going backwards. disgrace It’s not about controlling women’s bodies. It’s about aligning to the governing style of the state you choose. There’s few viable solutions for individual rights the past 2.5yrs by big gov’t. Top-down controls is a governing style of the left. Constraints have to be implemented. @Moondancer1626 SENDING YOU BIG HUGS I’m sure the GOP will be the first to slash and or deny increased funding towards welfare and foster care programs for unwanted children. After all, pro-life seems to halt after birth. Pro-life my ass. https://t.co/NMnvY2o5O9 There’s a Roe v. Wade protest happening at 5:30 at Burbank City Hall today if anybody is interested in going

Stay tuned There’s nothing wrong with @kanyewest - he’s having a normal reaction to a human experience very few of us on this planet can relate to (if anyone else could).

I might have just had one of the most meaningful It's not a conspiracy theory. It's a very central part of American history and culture. It's observable, it's recorded, it's not something I'm making up to make excuses. It's our history @DegenToonz present 🧨 https://t.co/FopN4CJEJa You've got Republican, so-called Christian nationalists talking about the birth rate of white Americans and how low they are, but it's a conspiracy theory for me to point out that white people cling to whiteness because it brings them power. And what I'm saying here is that white people usually are not going to sacrifice that in any real way. Why? Because that categorization comes with power. Most people wouldn't deliberately choose to live in a less favorable way in this society. That's why many European immigrants decided to exchange their accents, their language, their customs, and their cultures in order to move upward in society. It was survival. It cracks me up that people like you and other Twitter accounts are retweeting this as an anti-white tweet lol. My point is that white Americans cling to whiteness because it benefits them and no discourse around race is really going to change that. And that is something that is demonstrably observable by the fact that many white Americans do not have any connection to their countries of origin because their ancestors decided to put aside their cultures in order to assimilate into whiteness and thus benefit from it. It's always pretty funny to me when people describe really clear observable historical facts as a conspiracy theory. It's not a conspiracy theory to say that the categorization of white in this country has often come with power and privilege. So, @ShawnMcBreairty, with ""loves God"" in his bio, and ""being kind"" in his tweet, doxxes a young kindergarten teacher for daring to hang rainbow hearts on the wall and encouraging her class to act like family. I bet God thinks you're a real cunt, Shawn. I endorse this post. How dare Darren Aronofsky not cast a 600 lb actor. He needs to be canceled. Thank you @vulture Surprises. Honored. Totally conceited now. 
Thanks, @DumbIndustries + @MaryJoPehl !!! All my physical scars are visible during massage. I have many. They can feel the emotional pain too. 

I feel exposed. But I need to go, so I do. 

I close my eyes and pray to leave my body for awhile and then come back. To be with my girl, then return for my boys. My daily 🙏. I do things to keep from being engulfed by pain. 

Yoga. Acupuncture. Massage. Crying. 

Today, the massage therapist asked, what happened to you? Were you in a car accident? No. Bicycling accident? No. My little girl was and she died. 

Oh . . . I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine. ⬇️ https://t.co/9dQEXX2Cku Steaks are on the grill 🔥 https://t.co/8nkWJacjs7 I'm curious if you're able to actually explain to me what your understanding of this tweet is. 

Could you, for example define ""whiteness"" for me? anyways

The person's tweets came up on my timeline and just skimming through the nonsense made me easily determine them to be unhinged and aggressive. I never followed them, but they have been blocked. Dinner time! 🍽 https://t.co/9dxysgqfRu Elton John’s shopping addiction that makes him forced to continuously put out music is inspiring @LaurenJauregui will give the green light when it should come out.

Pay the man!! https://t.co/O7wQ4u8tiF Crazy I wanted a gf and then a study drops that women cheat more in relationships, someone really got my back out there 🤝💯 @OrangePaulp Wait that’s hot This is in the same spirit of what I was telling my mom the other day: folks are out here stuck with a financial decision they made when they were basically children and also getting crappy advice like this smh. Jurors came back w/unanimous decision &amp; awarded Vanessa Bryant $16 M and Chris Chester $15 M in damages against the LA County Sherrif’s Dept and the county Fire Dept. It's my birthday.  Will somebody send me some samshine? https://t.co/JH8qjcIrbJ If you understand that the US is a financially-sovereign fiat nation, you’ll understand that US taxpayers are not footing the bill for student debt cancellation, and that we can “afford” to cancel ALL student debt, offer FREE college, and guarantee UNIVERSAL healthcare. #MMT I want to curate playlists for Hotels 🏨 In a perfect world it would come out of Alex’s pocket.

Jury orders L.A. County to pay $31 million in Kobe Bryant crash photo sharing case https://t.co/Z35lUyNRZ5 @bungarsargon After taxes $100K in Cali is about $70K and if one’s student loans are upwards of $180k given interest, you’re actually not talking about people making $100K. Maybe you mean $200K? Also, there are truck drivers making more $$ than journos and teachers so…. Tag yourself fellas 😔 https://t.co/yH5jjtYD4U That was the worst student loan forgiveness plan ever lol. They might as well keep it. Getting rid of the interest rates would have been much more impactful. 10k don’t even cover a semester of school lmao Self Portrait. 🫂 watercolor brushes using @Procreate on iPad mini. https://t.co/qihJFytHqu North Hollywood where y’all at? 🏴‍☠️ #raiders #raidernation #rn4l https://t.co/AIGoI8xP7e The ‘My Pillow Guy’, Mike Lindell, still ranting about voter fraud. Now he claims, with no evidence, every vote in Utah is fake. I’d suggest Lindell go back to stuffing pillows, but his pillows suck and you wouldn’t want one anyway. https://t.co/BCZHdcYqZZ never cared about material things. 2024 Gardena (Calif.) Junipero Serra defensive back Dakota Fields is one of the best in the state. Early offers include Oregon, LSU, USC and Notre Dame among others @DucksDigest https://t.co/DmDHOaif3s My semi finals for wild rift are tonight… it’ll all be fine right? RIGHT??? 

I’m gonna need a glass of wine and plate of brownies to either celebrate or cry my tears into lol. Jesse Watters admits the Republicans should be concerned they may not win the midterms. https://t.co/9uJmyZmazv @wowthatshiphop 🎶quickest n̵i̵g̵g̵a̵ like a vulture🎶 (🗣quickest) https://t.co/A7HEwngT1R I still love this! Thank you @quintabrunson ❤️🥹 https://t.co/FCDKSBt3Xp none of this shit feels like it’s worth it at all Jeanine Pirro bashes student loan forgiveness, then reveals she “didn’t have to take out a loan” because her family paid for all of her tuition. Presumably her boxes of wine, too. https://t.co/OhsE872yjI One last time from The Ravine.

The director said the footage didn’t exist **on the server they had access to.** aka, they were locked out so they didn’t steal it.

📸: @stokes_flow https://t.co/fFhqYEahEX @bobclendenin @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy is one of the few things about our Golden state that I find truly embarrassing. A) If you want to be sneaky about your combo that is fine, but will in invite more salt.
B)weird to expect players to know every obscure combo possible
c) if your deck needs your opponent to not know how it works to win it’s not good
D) spell table amplifies this issue even more Louis has served people as a community organizer, outreach leader, and resource connector. He knows what it would take to change CA’s trajectory and has the temperament &amp; hope to bring real change. We can end homelessness so our children don’t face the same reality we do now. It seemed tragically á propos following attendance of a discussion with friend @LouisForCA which touched on California’s current lack of progress and current representational unwillingness to assure more affordable housing, when my four year old noticed an unhoused man downtown. It was an open secret that O’Farrell’s supporters would stack the room if @StonewallDemsLA didn’t endorse. It was the same thing for our race &amp; every challenger to a Dem incumbent in LA. Gatekeeping by the establishment is the norm, no matter how corrupt the incumbent is. listened to @theallinpod ep 100 and ready for the besties at @ALLIN_meetups LA! 

dream team with @anjalikundra_ @MelissaJDiaz ✨ https://t.co/CQXZqxDs2d Wow. @NASAJPL's Family Day was a blast! Saw lots of folks and met even more. It was lovely to see what everyone is working on and to see and hear the pride in the work they're doing. Thank you to everyone who made it possible! Oh wow look what we spotted at Power Up 90 in Little Tokyo.

It’s going to take ALL OF US to beat the establishment incumbent. @dianagonare could have served before or after she was on stage at a convention very easily. interrupting her on stage is very disrespectful of his team. i’m not a huge fan of either of them, but this is not a good look no matter who did it. I wish Costco pizza delivered America’s democracy is quite pure in that any citizen, even those totally lacking qualifications or competence, can run for office and in some cases, win Republican seats in the House of Representatives Unhinged, delusional insurrectionist @repscottperry, deeply in the crosshairs of the @January6thCmte, has thoughts about people upholding their oath of office. This is a bullshit response, and kind of fucked up. 100% If you have student loan debt, I forgive you Wow that’s a stretch, the constitution was written as The People, are the well regulated militia. Because we didn’t have a standing army. Well Regulated Militia specifically Refers to We The People,   It also gives the government the right to regulate it. wrong again dipshit.

The original X-men animated cartoon wasn’t good.(outside of a banger intro song) 
The carton actually put me off the X-men franchise until the movies and Evolution (and now they are easily my favorite comic team) I can’t with people who have a superiority complex because they paid student loans.

The system is fundamentally unfair, folks. We’ll ALL be better off when our young people aren’t saddled with massive debt.
