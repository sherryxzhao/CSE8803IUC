Music is the language of my soul. I’m a chameleon who can channel in different dimensions, different lifetimes. It’s going to be a long ride @FrankMikeDavis1 @AmoneyResists Absolutely, everyone of these people who did something like this: tried to get fake electors put across, tried to get votes thrown out, every single one of these cheating, election stealing illegal acts should get prosecuted. No one is above the law &amp; that includes “Sen” Graham. @nbsmith77 You'd have to ask them 🤷‍♂️ We are so thrilled to welcome @gp_jls our inaugural public-scholar-in-residence @USC_GSS (funded by @MellonFdn).

May he RIP🕊🕊 My brother didn’t answer my call but did tweet this moments later. Three big losses for the #Chargers defense with Derwin James, Bryce Callahan, and Sebastian Joseph-Day OUT against Miami’s high powered offense. You guys aren’t ready for what’s coming up! If you’ve been wondering where I’ve disappeared to, all will be revealed this week. This collaboration is EASILY the craziest one I’ve ever been involved with. Stay tuned 👀 Terron Armstead and Eric Fisher are active for Miami Dolphins

Teddy Bridgewater and Myles Gaskin are inactive When the Messiah comes all tweets will be resurrected and the big platforms and small platforms will integrate with each other with none to make them crash. @Johnlomeli7 @tize4PF This thread got me crying 😭 Dolphins left tackle Terron Armstead is officially ACTIVE against the Chargers. Here are inactives: https://t.co/qXFJsgDGM5 #Chargers WR Mike Williams is playing against the Miami Dolphins.

That gives QB Justin Herbert his three main WR’s healthy which he has rarely had this season in Keenan Allen, Williams, and Josh Palmer. @Baddboyhunt812 Folsom - If You’re a Viper 10 yrs ago I saw @deadmau5 in El Paso &amp; that show was one of the first that ignited my love for the scene &amp; fast fwd yrs later I get to see him &amp; another lifetime fav @kaskade with their new alias at the LA Coliseum (they haven’t played since edcLA) 🥺 my inner child is screaming “As a team, we really built something special… this brotherhood can’t be replaced.” — @PierceClarkson_

The @LATimes will continue to prop him up by lying to their readers that hundreds of thousands of unhappy residents and dozens of city councils are right wing ideologues. It’s sickening! We must be close to double digits on the Times writing in support of a local politician who just had 500 plus thousand residents sign a petition to remove him from office and over 30 cities vote no contest in his leadership. Gascon won many of the cities that now want him out. I’ve never seen a news outlet so dedicated to promoting a politician. I’m from back east, where the moment a politician is elected, journalists question and challenge everything they do. This love fest the Times has with Gascon is weird. https://t.co/2mTXIeyHUp The chances of the developers making ""socialist arguments"" for rent control are precisely zero.

America is failing young people. We’re bequeathing them a #ClimateCrisis. Tuition is obscene. Civil rights are jeopardized.

#NOWUNITED #WaveYourFlagTour https://t.co/PDeXJSqbYv Is this the most creative argument against firearms? Eating animals that have been shot by hunters, ingesting bullets. NOT that lead has made its way into the air, water, and soil. https://t.co/vyjaemBgsg And if you do this and then get annoyed when I honk at you for it I should be allowed to kick your car I'm the youngest mayoral candidate in Los Angeles history.

But I'm also the candidate with the best plan to end homelessness and invest in social services.

Looking for a progressive Democrat who will take on special interests and fight for every Angeleno? Join our movement. @Flockville @Ravens @BinjimenVictor Wait we have a 6’4” wide receiver on the roster . Wth is going on 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤨🧐 https://t.co/F1YtGGKVjg I truly believe everyone who posts hot takes and theories about euphoria has never actually experienced addiction or watching someone you love struggle with addiction Jordan Spieth’s pre-shot rehearsal looks a little odd, but it’s done with a distinct purpose.

Also ‘what street is Lafayette on’ is not a real question! Okay so the ALLIGATOR 4k from @Scream_Factory looks so goddamn good, it has to be seen to be believed. It has NEVER looked this good.

Hes gotta little time to show it -60% Haji from all reports i gotten did not impress Gregg in last camp, hes an athletic striker who can get hot it seems, will put up alot of goals in the Turkish league but maybe came on a little late to make the WC, i still think u can find use in him tho- 40% Pefok, i dont think Berhalter rates him, at least not for his system, to me he is a player u bring in the last couple minutes to try and somehow score a goal, other than that doesnt bring much else to the team- 50% i got the 1.21 gigawatts too.. see ya soon my boys, see ya soon x 😏 
💫🕛🔙🚀 https://t.co/usmOuv902o Pepi, we thought would be a lock to go to the WC but has not scored and has gotten limited minutes at Ausburg, looking back maybe staying in MLS would have secured him a WC birth, still i believe in his talent but time is ticking on him- 50% Ferreira has gotten alot of starts under Gregg, a player who always seems to find himself in the right spots, isnt clinical enough for me but combines well with his teammates he is limited physically to play as a 9 but will continue to score in MLS- 80% Sargent to me is Berhalters ideal striker, a player who can combine well, press the opponent, and has the physical tools to compete in a WC, if he keeps scoring hes going to the WC-70% chance A 🧵 on what I believe the percentage each striker has of making the WC, Sargent, Ferreira, Pepi, Pefok, Haji, Vasquez Day 2 of jury duty over.

Buses and trains should be free, an empty fare box would be manageable here, and we could shut up the haters in the process.

Win-win. :) Finally havetime

✅Don’t expect folks will act like you would. Everyone is built different, for better or worse. 🙈

✅Get everything in writing…EVERYTHING. Even if it takes longer to do so and sux. 🧾👀

✅Give what you want to get, because nature always seeks balance.😉🙏❤️ sometimes I just go to the bougie coffee shops in brentwood and pretend I’m a rich gay with a big ass house and lots of free time The amazing @ChiodoBros!

My daughter is screaming right now before her nap, “I want my cozy sleep sack! I want my COZY SLEEP SACK!!” #PowerPC had so much life in it when Apple abandoned it for x86. I mean, that's obviously the case because it's still around, and Freescale and IBM pour lots of R&amp;D money into advancing Power ISA.

If only Apple would've used x86 for laptops and stayed with ppc64 for pro Macs. Covid free and having the best day ever!

Yes, please. anything i touch is turning into gold, like i was sent from heaven. The reality that @joerogan @jordanbpeterson @TimJDillon dress up with the word “truth” is the fact people who look like them cling to their privilege, entitlement and societal benefits – justifying selfishness, denying gullibility, absolving guilt.

If I had a list of favorite Goldsmith scores, it would easily be in my top three. When racists or culturally inept fuckers take canned beans, corn, and “taco seasoning” (whatever the fuck that is), throw it in a bowl and call it taco soup. Yes. This is racist, born of ignorance, from creative ineptitude trying to cash in on a culture they know shit about. I’m gonna treat myself to the Megan Thee Stallion Tiny Desk concert and there’s nothing you can do about it! It’s all about getting to mainnet.

(i’m done now) @SpeedSportLife Baffles me the the biggest selling point of a Maverick is it's extreme value &amp; great gas mileage on the Hybrid.  Why anyone would pay over sticker would defeat the purpose of why it was built. Once the market stabilizes and the buyers evaporate, these are going to sell for a song i’m sorry to get heavy and dark on the TL, but if this post reaches even one person who’s suffering, then it’s worth it to me. because its so easy to feel alone, ashamed, and overwhelmed when shit hits the fan emotionally. seven years ago i really thought i was going to die from the weight of what i was going through. i felt completely empty and hopeless. i was lucky to have amazing friends who helped me see a light at the end of a seemingly endless tunnel. it did get better—it always does. this made me want to highlight a few of the ppl on here who are out here talking about it openly (@WRBolen, @lilpoasterboi, @bigcontentguy, @sashaperigo) in case reading their accounts of their MH struggles is helpful to anyone going through it which makes me think/worry about all the people—and especially men—that haven’t given themselves permission to talk about or even fully experience their emotions because it’s not socially condoned. Did a city planner write this https://t.co/HY0PIKUqdY and THAT reminds me that even as someone with a decent amount of mental health literacy, and as a woman (the more societally “accepted” gender to openly admit to mental health struggles) i still experience a high degree of shame when discussing this kind of thing The corkscrew of @WeatherTechRcwy definitely took us on a journey of some twists and turns 👀

Writers talk about how you can’t trust any writer who likes writing, but that’s bullshit. Writing is the purest joy in my life and has been since I was a kid.

We’re one of the only species to drink another animal’s milk 🤮 The theory of shock therapy, as I understand it, was ""things are going to really suck for 10 years, but in the long term, we're all going to ne way better off."" And well, it kind of looks like that's what happened in countries that didn't get invaded or have civil wars? @JonTanners man. that’s damn near what we have right now."

at this time. I’m sorry this is so somber, I rarely do it. But sharing these feelings is the only way I can keep them from swallowing me up inside. I will smile, have fun, laugh and just be at my happy place. It was our happy place too. But I’ll probably cry also... It’s not ideal, but I just have to do my best. (My bday is 9/30, she passed 10/1.) I try to lean into my life and fill it with as much joy as possible. But my sister was my best friend. She was my everything. It’s been nearly 8 years and it still hurts so much. Headed to Disneyland to celebrate my birthday for the next few days. But as always, my emotions are everywhere. This year in particular has been filed with so much guilt. My sister was a month into being 38 when she passed away and every year I pass that number it feels heavier.

No Clipper had a more disjointed 2021-22 than Norman Powell: new contract, new coach, a trade, an injury, a rehab, and a return all since August.

Next season, Powell could be the Paul George/Kawhi Leonard insurance policy.

#HederaNFTs #HederaHeatWave #HBARNFT https://t.co/6KwE81cKzX I don't think these people will stop being transphobic because they realize Nazis are also transphobic so I don't get this point at all. False flags are always possible but why would someone not transphobic choose to terrorize folks just so they can win an argument? Like ""sure, I dont mind when people are targeted and threatened w/ violence because of who they are or what they do. I don't mind people standing with guns in order to suggest violence is on the horizon because of who they are, but I draw the line at Nazis"" what? It takes a lot of energy and a certain degree of tolerance to hate to, as a person targeted by fascism, go and purchase hold, and wave a Nazi flag just to prove to transphobes that Nazis are on their side. I don't think transphobes get how taboo that imagery feels to most of us Anything is possible but I kinda wish more people understood that most trans folks just want to be left alone. We only loudly advocate for ourselves because we are constantly antagonized. Transphobes are overwhelmingly invested in antagonism; we'd like to be left alone. So is the theory here that a bunch of people who would be targeted by fascist policy showed up with Nazi flags to protest a Drag show so they could say ""look theyre nazis"" instead of those people just not engaging with that stuff at all?

I now understand how, when I was young, I’d hear phrases like ‘Social Security’ or ‘Medicare’ or ‘Corporate Profits’ or ‘Glass-Steagall’ and it all sounded like something I should Google but didn’t have Google. Audi, Pfizer, General Mills suspend advertising on Twitter due to content moderation concerns. @fozberry1 @jonbernhardt @jbouie Stalkers will happily pay more than that for postage, and they have to go to the post office or FedEx store while it's open and have to appear relatively normal.

The Fuck You montage and then there’s this scene where someone asks a character if he’s moving. 

He says, “Bin Laden can drop another one right next door, I ain’t moving.”

For me, that movie really captured a certain energy I’ve only felt in NYC. https://t.co/yckX07hmJO We all are. https://t.co/i84xeJRsfA @MzGossipGirl i was not prepared for this end result 😭 I do not envy those who see what’s unfolding but have too much to lose to know the cathartic freedom found in honest reflections to wet the tongues of the thirsty, for they will lose what they have sought to protect with their silence. @Ariel_Comedy She wanted to get rid of the NY film tax incentive so we would’ve lost a lot more than that show.

They didn’t break with him when he incited, directed, and allowed a violent takeover of the American government. Need to hire a studio manager ASAP.

When it’s a coup attempt. Like the one a year ago today. House set is a go for this weekend and i have some new house to play 💪 I was naive. I knew the American populace could elect a dumb person or someone whose policies I differed with. But I assumed the winnowing effect of our electoral system would prevent us from ever putting a madman in office. Boy howdy was I wrong!! No one is above the Law in Australia.

The President of the United States was gleefully watching and rewinding footage of rioters taking over the Capitol Building to overturn an election...and that still didn’t trigger the 25th I bought a T-shirt (from Roppa).

Schools in session. #Forbiddenkingdom @santaanitapark @MyRacehorse @spendthriftfarm https://t.co/Dn5opglOY3 It’s a damn shame that over half of LA’s #ARP money went to fund LAPD when we have thousands of families struggling to stay housed.

We’ve given LAPD more money than ever before, &amp; we’ve got nothing to show for it.

We should’ve funded:
Housing Assistance
Jobs
Mental Health care Fuguring out the costs of those externalities (and thus the fees) will require careful study. Too high, and you have a de facto maximum that results in desirable spaces not being built. (And you generate no revenue.) Too low, and your community is slammed with excess parking.

@rainbowbarandgrill https://t.co/WmK3cyt0Mm One of the missiles from Russia used to kill civilians had ""For the children"" painted on the side of it.
That same missile killed 5 kids. 🤨🧐🤬🤬🤬 #StopPutinNOW (And as a happy side effect, it creates a new stream of revenue that can be used to mitigate those externalities.) A simple per-space fee that increases with the number of spaces is the best of both worlds: it forces developers to internalize the costs of their decisions, while still giving them the option to build parking where its benefits truly outweigh those externalities. Just filthy 😳 https://t.co/1EF8CyqJxN They also ignore what I take to be a deeper critique by Shoup, which is that planners cannot divine the optimal number of parking spaces for any given development. Maximums are certainly less destructive when wrong, but if we appreciate that deeper critique, we should be humble. @TimSevenhuysen @karonmoser Tim doesn't know the meme :( Loving the new FANTASTIC BEASTS trailer now playing that spends the first half showing old HARRY POTTER footage desperately trying to sell this film 😂 @myglyvr Not me thinking that was actually Tae I actually buy the argument that off-street spaces have externalities in that they encourage vehicular traffic. But parking maximums that aren't zero (a problem for conceptual reasons) strangely imply that these externalities don't exist below some threshold. Should I host a sub tourney? And the winning team will get $$ and the person with the most kills gets a designed pair of keeks/ your gamer tag adidas shoes? Lmk!! Heading back to the cold and frigid Massachusetts.

https://t.co/u7O9ElIRkv The closest we get it Mastroianni, Levy, and Trenchard not losing a single lacrosse game from March through July, picking up an ACC Title, an NCAA D1 Title, and a World Cup Gold Medal in the process.

Arguably cooler👀 It’s very sad to see so many talented staff let go from 100 Thieves today. 

So many of these people worked their asses off and accomplished amazing things. Even though I know they will land on their feet it’s still upsetting to see. 😥 I wanna believe this was a clever way to get around a S&amp;P note over ""Please do not slap Horse; it is very imitateable behavior."" 😆 🥁RodCon '22 Artist Spotlight: As a drummer, Jacob Richards has toured with Jagwar Twin, Oliver Tree and many others.

Back on the air tomorrow! https://t.co/SdCNQshIXG The Broncos have officially been eliminated from playoff contention. @libsoftiktok I like supporting freedom of speech advocates with my media presence for solidarity. Made one this morning. Having it as a way to still follow figures who are removed for their opinions makes it worthwhile, for me. #Chargers beat the Denver Broncos 34-13. They now control their own destiny yet again being 9-7 and setting themselves up for a big game against the Raiders next week. LA just needs to win and they are in. 
#DENvsLAC Chargers win 34-13. A victory in Vegas next Sunday gets you in the tournament. Started off 2021 the best way I know how — in the air!🎪🥳

You can attack white supremacy without throwing Black people under any transportation. Show a modicum of gratitude for the CRM that eventually led to our parents immigrating here to thrive. @Martina I was there!  I was your net ball girl! Noah Fant gets into the end zone for the Broncos’ first TD of the afternoon. I was working 6/7 days a week. Fuck me, today is my last day Being up 34-6, #Chargers S Derwin James is on the sideline with his helmet off. Safe to assume his day is done. President Biden and Vice President Harris will speak at the US Capitol on Thursday to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Capitol.

Disgraced, twice impeached, one-term ex-President Trump will hold a ‘press conference’ on the same day to gripe that they stole the election. And yet you follow me on Twitter.

#DENvsLAC #Chargers QB Justin Herbert just passed Philip Rivers for most touchdowns in a season by a Chargers quarterback with 35. In his second season. Broncos 6

Rounds responds to Trump’s lunatic attack on him &amp; adds this in his new statement about Trump’s lies: 

""Vice President Mike Pence stood his ground, acknowledged President Biden’s victory and acted with integrity. It’s time the rest of us do the same."" SPANISH TECH HOUSE 🏠 This statement by @SenatorRounds should be applauded simply because so few Republicans have any gumption to stand up to Trump’s insane non-stop lies &amp; lunacy. He is doing the inverse here of what @tedcruz did. Rounds is doubling down and expanding on what he said. Good for him.

If Herro is here next year and isn’t prime AI, he’ll get crucified. And not just on a basketball level, on a personal one too. happy father’s day to me https://t.co/XowIOeMgDY Finally a year older but I’ll never change… https://t.co/OTycw3K1F0 It’s especially funny when you remember it was these same “get the big whale” fans who wanted *Russ*. Who cried when we didn’t get Hayward.

Gotta thank my hubby @glitczh for getting me into NFTs and Web3. Joined this wicked group of people for my first collection. Can I get a woot woot! @wickedcraniums https://t.co/mJ2njtpxzG In my experience government can work very effectively in situations like this. The public needs to see us get Monkeypox in hand and the fast action, competence &amp; caring necessary to get us there is all within our power. /end There is a lot of real work involved in preventing monkeypox from becoming endemic: buying vaccines, empowering labs, pushing CDC &amp; FDA to move faster, listening &amp; responding to community needs as they emerge, anticipating challenges.

Every obstacle can &amp; must be overcome. 14/ There is an excellent discussion on all of this from @reluctantlyjoe and @DrJayVarma on the current situation, the shortcomings &amp; the solutions needed.

Thankfully the Administration has provided an open line to experts like them. They must keep an open line to the community.13/ 5. The final point— communicating clearly and directly with the public. Straight talk.

When will things be done.
What is the clearest public health advice.
Hotlines.
How we are doing against are commitments.
Reporting on the results. 12/ We then need to collect the testing and infection data from all the states — taking whatever authority is needed— and report publicly. 11/ 4. Once we can make a commitment for how long it will take to vaccinate high risk ppl, we can be clear for how long NPIs to reduce transmission would be needed.

We can better expect people to make lifestyle changes if they know how long they will be needed. It’s not forever.10/ Set up a one stop shop to get immediate access to therapies and make it clear to physicians that they should not let their patients suffer.

At the same time, expedite an EUA using the NIH study. Aim for weeks not months. 9/ 3. From anecdotal reports, therapies work quite well l— but are still too hard to access. Too many people are in too much pain.

The complexity is that the therapy is approved for small pox so we need guidance &amp; a much easier off label process.8/ Scientists tell me at home tests can be developed here as monkeypox can be detectable on the gum line &amp; other places.

FDA should publish what is needed for EUA &amp; the slew of at home COVID test manufacturers will jump on it. 7/ Now that we have commercial labs beginning to produce PCR tests at scale, those tests need aggressive distribution.

Many of the symptoms do not present as monkeypox, so tests should be available in places beyond doctor’s offices in communities. 6/ 2. Once we tell people when we can have this contained, can we lay out a multi-pronged strategy for managing monkeypox in the meantime.

That begins with testing. 5/ The vaccine doses need to be distributed to high priority jurisdictions regardless of the requests from those jurisdictions.

In other words, set up vaccine clinics in Miami &amp; Houston whether the states ask for them or not. We know where the populations at risk are. 4/ From what I understand, we should have enough doses to vaccinate over a million people in the next several weeks with their first dose. 

We need to lay out that timetable &amp; the timetable for vaccinating the hundreds of thousands of additional at risk people &amp; for second doses.3/ 1. The end game is to quickly vaccinate high risk groups as quickly and urgently as possible.

We have no hope of containing this until that is done. 2/ Damn forgot that Diamante was such a savage she needs to be in the #Tbs title scene #AEW https://t.co/4sO64bI2lO With this beautiful inside out human being ❤️❤️@ParinHeidari at

Someone recently told me that they would share my content bc “they were cool like that” as a means of payment. LOL. Yesterday is what happens when Democrats lose 8 out of 14 presidential elections in my lifetime (including twice will winning popular vote) AND failing to exercise their power when they actually have it. Barack Obama was re-elected president and couldn’t even get his SCOTUS nominee a hearing, let alone a vote. 

Presumably, Republican presidents have gotten their nominees on the court even with Democratic senate majorities. 

Are they just better at this than us? If you’re surprised by this turn of events you weren’t paying attention.

Agree. It is an unfortunate myth/ wishful thinking that an assault on Roe will be what unites women across the aisle. In 2016, Trump promised to only nominate anti-Roe jurists &amp; white women still supported him 47-45. I wish that would change but we can’t count on it. @PaulCra33107260 @nbctv @PaulCostabile It cost Him whole 30 seconds  on video… I’ll let him say it was a full minute .  Pathetic .

And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one.” - Tupac Shakur (1993) Thinking about the comment I made on @OgLakyn’s recent lewk and realized maybe when people are “looking me up and down,” there’s just so much good going on that they don’t know where to focus. I’ve always assumed that over it being a bad thing anyway.

The recent attacks on reproductive rights &amp; the environment show how scary things can get. We must never cease efforts to make our country live up to our ideals. Last 2 days have been the worst. Only one more to go. When #NFT meets the #CreatorEconomy

We haven't seen 1% of this technology's potential. #MCU gave us a taste of the creative and economic potential of worldbuilding; #NFTs with #CommercialRights and a productive #community will turn worldbuilding into a spectator sport.

@0x_ara Friggin autocorrect “I could do your job. You could never do my job. Just remember that.”

Izzy saying he can do (our) job because he has a YouTube channel is like me saying I can do his job because I hit a heavy bag five days a week.

Both are claims are dumb. 🙄 Ascension of Awareness, Christ Consciousness, The Buddha Nature, whatever attempt feeble language merely dances around- it is not heavy, but weightless. It empties. It unblocks. It liberates. It is culture, it is society that is the fettering ball &amp; chain weighting down humanity. The Supreme Court makes our country a more dangerous &amp; deadly place, while they demand law enforcement authorities shoo peacefully protesters from their neighborhoods. An #AmericanReset is long overdue. And that’s a wrap! Thanks so much to everyone who stopped by this weekend!

Is there any other way to charitably understand Dr. Mohler saying anything else? 

I…I don’t really know what to say. 2016 Mohler &amp; so many others I respected said this wasn’t the case.

The argument here seems to be that being transgender somehow makes you more predisposed to violent sex crime which is really only a belief you have if you're honing in on someone's transness. I'm pretty sure nobody argues that being transgender means you can't be a criminal I think this is the striker you should be focused on bud https://t.co/HeuwNkydEP So to me it's confusing that the same logic isn't applied to the majority who are demonstrably more likely to actually exert these crimes and get away with it. Why not apply a similar logic to a more dangerous group? Why don't we do that? There are demonstrably far more cis white men in prison for these crimes than trans women collectively. If this is the complete sum of all trans women who have committed violent sexual crimes, that's an incredibly small percentage of a pretty small minority Im also really fascinated by this logic because if we  follow it to its complete conclusion,we should all be overwhelmingly limiting the rights and access of cis white men who overwhelmingly statistically are more likely to exert violence against women and girls at larger numbers Sitting next to @itsmarkmoran for the next 6 hrs ama https://t.co/oYnklWmvd8 Been In the studio locked in every night for the past week and let me just say..

If, for example someone said ""kill the libs"", do you really think that that is the exact same as someone threatening to bomb the White House? believe all music fan clubs will eventually be on chain. the ability to drive a tighter relationship between artists &amp; fan by way of NFTs is massive. @medallionfm leading the way—

guess who’s next? I don't think you're capable of connecting the dots really. Obviously I understand that saying kill the terfs is offensive and I wouldn't say it personally. I'm confused by why you're conflating that with threatening to bomb a specific location full of sick children? To me it's kind of fascinating the degree of violence that can be exerted against trans folks and that seen as reasonable and understandable by some and then when a trans person who exists within said violence says fuck you that's akin to terrorism. meetup vibes 🎉❤️🌊 @irl_alpha @patrickamadon @beginbotbot https://t.co/MGbruQdAHs Who's ready?? 🙌⚡️💛💙 Let's go!! https://t.co/Kh7gpdxyNH I don't know if I'm fully comfortable with the idea of limiting people's rights because people within that certain group have committed crimes or said strange things on Twitter. Interesting how that's never used as a precedent against limiting the freedoms of white men. And I'm curious if this is evidence of terrorism, why wouldn't you use the actual violence against trans folks as evidence in a similar way? Is calling someone a cunt the same as threatening to bomb a children's hospital? So your evidence is people wearing t-shirts and trans women who are convicted of violent crimes? How exactly is that similar to bomb threats? I'd appreciate an explanation of that.

(2/3). #CaWx https://t.co/EIJ2q1RhBs EC ensembles are casting an amplified pattern over the northeastern Pacific next week, w/ storm after storm carving up the autumnal Pacific High. ☀️

Not in the way we want it to. 

#TEAMMOLLY, you make all the days more bearable. I don’t feel alone in regular moments because of you. Thank you 🙏 It’s passing the split peas that I used to buy to make her favorite soup without picking up a bag. It’s watching her brothers and friends grow up, while she’s forever 12.

If that dialogue were to actually happen, it would lead to a revolution, don’t you think? One of the major problems with our current stage of capitalism is that capitalism’s pretense is that those who earn the most money are those who work the hardest or who have the most uniquely valuable efforts. But this isn’t the reality right now and everybody knows it.

@latsondheimer https://t.co/AiFFpubrzP It is really hard to want to work the rest of today. Just so tragic. The GOP is obsessed with things that aren’t real.

Trans people they imagine in women’s bathrooms vs actual women’s bathrooms where this has never been a problem. This week @santaanitapark kicks off my externship with @1ST_Racing.

I’m convinced. Being from Texas used to be something I was proud of. Now, I’m just embarrassed &amp; ashamed. I consider myself lucky to have been gone from there for 12 years.

It really is a shame that so many Heat fans are MAD that the Heat drafted, developed and extended two franchise-cornerstone caliber players. 

One’s 25. One’s 22. 

One’s been an all-star and earned 3 all defensive nods. One won 6MOTY.

Just threw Aaron Jones Sheesh what a collapse FINAL: #Rockies 4, #Dodgers 1. Brendan Rodgers (12) HR in the 1st. Multi-hit days from rookies Sean Bouchard (2-4, R, RBI) &amp; Michael Toglia (2-3). RBI from B-Rod, McMahon, Bouchard &amp; Tovar. Germán Márquez great start to end his ‘22- 6 IP, 1 H, 1 R, 8 K. Two-inning save for Bard! Survived Disneyland with both sets of moms for the first time and even for a theme park expert it was theme parking on the hardest difficulty but we did it.

Like many cyclists, I have “my shop.” It is where I bought my first Cannondale. And promptly crashed it in the parking lot 🤭

Will I do it again? Time will tell. Nevertheless, I’m here for however long it takes.  🚀 5. Rinse &amp; Repeat
 
So you’ve followed all these steps. Now what? 

KEEP DOING IT EVERYDAY TILL IT WORKS. NEVER STOP.

I’m doing this with my music career and will do it again with @VceezyNFT on @hedera 

Imagine if I combine both fan bases one day? Hmm… https://t.co/XSbI1jxzuz 4. Post release is key

Marketing a release/drop is easy, finding moments after is where the success is had. In music, it’s concerts/touring. Same for @VceezyNFT. We have our digital venue “The Liftoff” going live next week for our first ever live “test” concert https://t.co/75RKIv6BrV Kings ! For those that may not know, I’m also a recording artist. I didn’t release ANY new music in 2022 and still had one of my biggest years in streaming. 

This is how I did it and how I’ll do the same with  @VceezyNFT … 🧵👇🏽

This dilution of attention is what BTC maximalists are really troubled by- when we are all divided, so will our investment, attention, and interests.

BTC tends to absorb much of it back, eventually If the @RamsNFL and especially #MathewStafford can eliminate turnovers tomorrow they win. One is too many against 49ers. Hopefully Stafford's last INT of the season was last weekend. Can't be so committed to threading ball into obvious coverage!

White checks are unclickable. Jokermen Podcast would like to make clear that who gives a shit @politicoalex So he’s going to be asking for the vote from people who tried to *check notes* hang him?

Which, for Jim Morrison, sounded entirely plausible. This is stupid and confusing. IMO, the old Twitter blue was fine the way it was. Pay money for additional features, makes sense. Why add the stupid checkmark? It serves no purpose other than to be confusing. So I’ve now seen two different kinds of checkmarks on Twitter, white and blue. The white ones seem to be people who were verified pre-Tofu Takeover, but the blue ones it seems can be either actual verification (a notable person) or Twitter blue purchased verification??

🎥 @dakredphotography https://t.co/8T2DcisW8s I’ve written a lot about Tamir, his death, and those who have let his killer live with impunity ever since.

25 years ago today 
1/22/60 - 11/22/97
@INXS https://t.co/kz2RJNqSuW Eight years is both a long time and a wink of an eye, depending upon your perspective. For a kid of 12, I suspect it feels like forever. America has had a lot of time to change to save more kids like Tamir, and we haven’t done it. I wonder whether he would be disappointed in us. Bring home Kramoda for thanksgiving. Your family will be too busy sipping to ask those uncomfortable questions. ☕️🤫 Ball game #opendorse https://t.co/hbXldV4bKz I went to the site of the shooting weeks later. Cleveland’s winter had frozen the police car’s tire tracks into the mud. As much as has happened these last eight years, though, at least one thing hasn’t: cops can still do what they did to Tamir and expect impunity. @nymike100 @amicsta You think Monroe isn’t great?? It’s got awesome schools, amazing houses, and the neighborhood has a bunch of kids my sons age to grow up with. Pretty fucking great to me!! https://t.co/Tm6yCnwxys @kneerecon @joncoopertweets Actually, race IS a factor here. The GOP is so racist that they’ve decided to back a black known and proven liar who is utterly unqualified over a qualified black man. That’s the personification of racism. King Charles’ first state banquet. It was at Buckingham Palace for President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa. https://t.co/IpAWur00vP I don’t know precisely why Timothy Loehmann said Tamir was “maybe 20” eight years ago today. It’s likely, though, that his reasoning had to do with the fact that our society considers a cop shooting a black man to death over even the slightest perceived threat to be permissible. Happy Tuesday! As a lead-up to (USA) Thanksgiving, I wanted to thank a few folks each day who made my life better from knowing them. Monday, I thanked a few individuals. Today I thank @dungeoncraft, whose YouTube videos finally inspired me to start a D&amp;D campaign for my daughter. i forgot about this ABSOLUTE BANGER The trick, as I just wrote this week, is to envision us black folks as something mightier than we are in order to validate or excuse what is then done to us. It isn’t a compliment. It is a justification.

Scream 3 turns 22 today! @JorCru and I reevaluate this Y2K classic, noting what you may have missed before…the undeniable parallels between Stab’s producer, “John Milton,” and Scream 3’s real-life producer (and convicted abuser), Harvey Weinstein . https://t.co/LidOtFJ13F i WILL stop at the dennys and CHANGE my FATE I’M DROPPIN’ THE HAMMER 🔨 https://t.co/g8MHBX9lrp .@TeamHendrick’s @chadknaus gets his first look at the track #NASCAR built inside the @lacoliseum and stops to talk w/ @NASCARHall member @DaleJr in Turn 4. #BuschLightClash https://t.co/av1wN2aGnR Which NFT should I release next? @opensea #NFTs https://t.co/V3xSTnqnUq @rocbelushi @Toure White people CAN use the word.

Stop copying and pasting on time timeline for HIT TWEETS!

Thats why I check my own charts. Y’all b lying @mrchrisgarcia Nah, hard pass on that. Y’all gotta b copying and pasting cuz aint no way everybody saying its #1 on AM and mine still saying #2 Has anybody ever gone to the Super Bowl experience??? Thinking about hitting that up this weekend it looks pretty dope @DannyFleitas But we get guilted for being like that Ummm.... this is a fun game. https://t.co/nDBy6bU20N Lastly, it’s the only burger that has the balls to go without ketchup and taste absolutely fantastic. Fat burger for the win. Whataburger and five guys don’t even belong in the conversation. https://t.co/5yc0ai5zJ2 Although they don’t call themselves a smashburger, 5 years ago they switched to the smash method. “We use to press our meat into a patty before, but now we do that on the grill.”So essentially as a smashburger, they beat out Shakeshack IMO. https://t.co/ci23S9lzAy It’s price point, and consistency is on par with In-N-out, which is often cited as the reason why In-N-Out is better. I would argue the taste and quality of Fatburger meat is even better, since they grind and prepare their meat in-house every morning, according to the staff here. https://t.co/TGRo13FvNQ Fatburger is an L.A. Burger founded here in 1947, a year before In-n-out. https://t.co/cyRN5qq65s Folks will argue about In-n-Out vs Five Guys, Shake Shack, or even Whataburger. But Fatburger always gets left out of this convo. It is highly underrated and under appreciated. Here are some facts. A thread: https://t.co/12c2xwcjJc Thanks Lauren! That means so much coming from you! Good afternoon you sexy people! Mwahhhhhh Some of us come from a different soccer culture than the typical american one, idk why people dont realize we FEEL the game a little different New twenty88 yes please 🙌🏿 We try to get outside a little every day.

He only ever liked one pilot (out of five), and it was becoming increasingly clear we weren’t on the same wavelength. Now I’m with four reps (two managers, two agents) and each have taken to different scripts. It’s so refreshing!! One thing I’ll add to this (especially if you’re looking for reps!) is to reiterate how important it is to have reps who respond to material. The pilot that got me staffed? 1st rep said “I don’t understand it.” Pilot that got me the latest meeting? He said  “I can’t sell this.” Feeding my soul😩 https://t.co/5VmE0JcGXy Another Big Cap day in the books at the Great Race Place @santaanitapark.

And so policy and political programmes for social housing have to take the question of evictions as seriously, even more so imho, as questions of financing, maintenance, etc. Finally got to the registration page. “Are you interested in attending a public lecture with @Laelaps on Tuesday, November 2?”

Fuck yeah I am!! The real world implication here is that social(ised) housing should not be the abode of evictions. Evictions - the forced removal of tenants - in social housing are a political error, and we must insist that social housing get as close as possible to the eradication of evictions. Bannon won’t like prison food. 
They cook the meat 
&amp; it hasn’t turned yet. But I think we need to be explicit in this principle again and again, and therefore any policy ""reform"" that accepts any unnecessary evictions (on grounds of health and safety) that are not the choice of the tenants is immediately compromised. And we wants world without that. Apropos nothing, literally just a thought that bears repeating: the tenant power movement has to, explicitly, stand on the principle that we are fighting for a world without evictions. Full stop. It's aprinciple and how we get there and make it practicable is up for debate. these magazines just arrived 🫡 https://t.co/mqdazbyAwK Meeting Judy Heumann was the highlight of my life https://t.co/55rX6v6dZu I hate the ghoul

Who even is this guy? 🫣 It’s really lovely to get so much new engagement on Twitter. But it makes me mad that people are listening to my message when men who have been trying to say the same exact thing have been ignored, mocked, abused and dismissed for decades. Please listen to male voices intently. thinking about you + me + the ocean https://t.co/4D0hdE3iFO Never sit down ANYWHERE at a dog park. Not on the floor. Not on the curb. Not on the chairs. It’s covered in piss.

I am flabbergasted. Here is the new District Attorney of San Francisco straight-up lying through her teeth on Twitter. Sending love to my friends working at HBO Max or on HBO Max shows. ❤️‍🩹

The streaming wars have transformed TV from what used to be “stable” industry into an unpredictable nightmare, but I just hope everyone is able to land on their feet. Is a certificate of deposit that pays 38% APY good or nah?

@Lions We’ve arrived at the point where white conservatives very clearly believe anything that doesn’t actively kill people, strip away their rights or destroy the world is ”woke” Of course Ron DeSantis thinks any concern over monkeypox is overblown. DeSantis: “I am so sick of politicians, and we saw this with COVID, trying to sow fear into the population. We’re not doing fear.” DeSantis obviously doesn’t know any gay men. The fear is real. Never doing fwb again. Commit or choke 📢ATTENTION RESIDENTS📢: tell the med-student on your team they are killing it, in front of your attending.

And he is incredibly handsome for the cherry on top. “The Body That Loves You”… Many people ask me what the main difference between writing a tv pilot and a movie is, and basically it’s an extra 70-80 pages to hate yourself. @Viggie_Smalls93 I like how during some screenings of Everything Everywhere All At Once,
he said there weren’t any roles for him (implying the market only wanting him to play stereotypes and pigeon holed roles) and it was because of Crazy Rich Asians he felt that mold break and he could return."

Stafford &amp; Kupp save the season. My god I am UNWELL 😭🤮 #RamsHouse What a freaking win for the Rams. Tom Brady and the Bucs tie it late. Rams have 42 seconds left for a game winning drive.

See you suckas next week. changing one of these, or multiple, during dinner rush was hell. the boxes are heavy and if the hoses were tangled, a nightmare I see you, @vicious696. https://t.co/NQgCtTPjmm cooking with garlic and WILLING my roommate to come in and say ""mmm something smells 😊👍"" I know they didn’t just say the mafia is comparable to the damn Klu Klux Klan… Omg this game is crazy🤯 Tom Brady said I aint done yet mf My freezer is serving Miss Antarctica realness , with the cold mist coming out when I go to get my cauliflower Mac like ok little polar cap moment TOM FKN BRADY A real nigga would’ve went for the 2 Holy shite!

I’ve always loved this wild design because I too long for a day when Meggan Puceanu Braddock, whose army called her Gloriana, is prominently displayed on all X-Men merchandise YOU. GUYS. Dexter and his knives. And the prop knives.  #DexterNewBlood https://t.co/KJJyDHqQHu I’ve felt about as comfortable watching this game as a Disneyland mascot on a hot summer’s day The thrift shops in LA are terrible. I suspect it’s because there’s so many people buying to resell. Goodwill’s in small town Oregon are somehow 10X better. I keep hearing “it’s hard to beat a team 3 times in the same year”. Is it? It’s happened 17 times! 

That statement makes zero sense

Everyone’s journey is going to be different - but blanket statements like “women can’t do that” are harmful and degrading. We can, and we do. A lot of people think this kind of change isn’t possible for a woman naturally. I promise you it is, it just takes TIME and consistency. To say that I must be using steroids because “women can’t do that” is not only sexist, it diminishes all the work I have done. @NotHoodlum What happened to the separation of church and state? https://t.co/KHIeGCa0O3 I wanted Ace so bad https://t.co/hsEd8zKkKa just realized we should be getting a trailer for the crown soon right?? elizabeth debicki in THE revenge dress @0xFACELESS Fused him with a void.

The unfortunate part for me is these new, wider range of celebs will be required to have no thought diversity to keep playing on the stage, backed by the mainstream machine. That’s the real problem, not how they look. Woke up still in the studio n made the saddest beat ever this morning . I Need to Go Home Elise Stefanik ran a Facebook ad alleging that “Democrats were plotting an electoral insurrection by giving amnesty to illegal immigrants and create a permanent majority.”

There’s no call to violence, per se. But the concept of a conspiracy to take over America is there. As someone that benefited from media shifting to a more open minded space in regard to range in aesthetics, I have no impulse to criticize the appearance of other people in magazines. Buy the cover you like. That’s the way to say what you want to see. Remember they’re humans. Whether it’s White Nationalist websites or Tucker Carlson’s show, the contours of the Great Replacement Theory are basically the same

That naturally-occurring demographic shifts in our society are instead ascribed to a broad conspiracy by elites trying to punish White Americans STOKED ABOUT MY MINT HARVEST https://t.co/GBeLC7sZGp @GoonerSwarny @Arsenal players omg wtf I’m actually about to hit 1k followers… i never had this many before🥲 TY SO MUCH #posse @ThePossessedNFT WHO GONNA BE THE LUCKY ONE? 👀

Opening a popular restaurant called “Terms and Conditions” and the menu looks like an iPhone update When I set myself up for comfortable nap conditions (low light, book, king sized bed, gentle music) I do not sleep but here? On the couch? Where I’ve left the light on solar flare mode? AC blowing my body to frigid temperatures? That’s a nap’s secret. Happy to be here, if a kid can play all three why can’t I help with all three.

School had already dismissed. LAPD is reporting one person injured and the suspects fled by car. This is the HS my oldest is set to go to in the fall. So I guess I'll just sit here with that. Another mass shooting at a clinic in Oklahoma. Shooter is dead. Our country and the “but muh guns” bullshit are both fucked. Regarding the Depp trial, as someone who has been lied about and experienced fallout in various friendship circles before, I applaud his efforts towards speaking his truth.

I always despised such ""journalists"" Wow she’s dating me Invest big in the affinity markets and get momentum and word of mouth and loyal repeat business. Then follow with outreach to the big middle if you’ve done your job right. White audiences are your big upside, not your primary focus. Let them join the party once it’s roaring. Last last thing: Whenever I see marketers for films with strong people of color leads working with resources that are 1/10th of the “mainstream” (white) marketing budget I wanna scream.

So if you’re a marketer who hasn’t studied those examples—begin there. Did I mention it’s for a movie Getting paid $150 to make a single dish as a sample, you love to see it All this isn’t about humblebragging. It’s to say this isn’t as hard as it looks. Learn the lessons of these examples—bring me in and I’ll happily walk you through them, with visuals—and you can do it too—if your product also kicks ass.

Congratulations @MoneyB on becoming a father 🥺 https://t.co/Izpe4Xmt4N I told Warner Bros. to do the same for Crazy Rich Asians—to screen the film with as many Asian American influencers as possible early, because it was awesome, and because this was the group you needed as ambassadors to the world.

Folks, he sent a violent mob to physically prevent certification. 

And he planned on using the military to seize voting machines. 

Sounds real to me. He showed up in his final regular season PCH Cup!

What a night, @0toEli.

#RaiseTheStandard https://t.co/3wUpF5Vswe nft twitter today hahaha ❤️ https://t.co/Dqhvv7kYRz L.A. poppin rn… ✌🏾 Used fusible web to bond cheap spiderweb-pattern Halloween novelty lace to black velveteen, but deliberately didn’t let the fusing dissolve *completely* and got this incredible cracked stone/old leather effect on this cloak. https://t.co/xdBS3lkarK The loser of the election was going to use the military to seize voting machines.  

Trust me, if you heard about this in any other country, you wouldn’t be debating whether it was really a coup attempt. Trump even drafted an order for the Secretary of Defense to seize voting machines! 

Just because Trump didn’t get away with stealing the election doesn’t mean that he wouldn’t have if he could. Kyrsten Sinema believes she’s giving her constituents what they want. 

If that were true, she wouldn’t have an 8% approval rating among Democrats.

#LosAngeles l #CA
Early reports indicate there may be more than one shooter. No word on the exact number of victims, or the extent of the injuries.
More information as it becomes available. https://t.co/rVp1ISjsnE Asked the woman at the airport boarding area if anyone was using the seat next to her, with her purse on it. Her friend was coming right back, she said. Funny, no friend has materialized and her purse is still enjoying a seat in a full boarding area. My mother ran away from her boarding school three times. On her third attempt, my great grandmother hid her in the basement. My mother always slept with the light on. The darkness carried too many nightmares and insufferable memories of the horrific trauma — she had endured. I can clarity the comparison easily.

It’s thrilling just how many plethora of people have played so far… definitely one of those magic moments in time. 

What a ride… and it’s been little more than a week. It is a moral imperative that we fight the homophobic, transphobic, and anti-sex work misinformation around #MonkeyPox because it will result in real violence against our communities.

We cannot be silent. We will not repeat what happened with HIV/AIDS. https://t.co/nQvbUqnZih #MonkeyPox is not an STI, nor is it limited to Gay men.

Media outlets cannot continue this dangerous rhetoric repeating the harm from the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Take down this misinformation @AP. https://t.co/imh9VsHKjr Little Bit by Lykke Li/Drake was a moment. Go watch how I win at this challenge but still lose 😂 🚨 10 WEEK MEDIA SERIES 🍿

Like I think I could do 14mph. But scared my mind that sprints like I’m still 18 doesn’t match my body that is 37. Don’t need no torn muscles. Spent the afternoon recording the mighty, iconic goddess Carla Bozulich for #Youareclearlyinperversion, the project I’ve been developing with @thorharris666 (and an epic roster of other magnificent artists, TBA soon). 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 https://t.co/aPXvXJXYez We have a real chance to flip this district blue in November!

It’s the eyes, for starters. Had a really nice convo w/ my bartender and when I got my bill I was only charged for 1 beer out of the 3 I ordered + food. When I brought it up she shrugged it off. Even if looking for a nice tip (which I left) it’s still a nice gesture🍺🍺 https://t.co/b1ex3A5lnC I believe this because folks still try it. Go in a fish market that’s not run by a Black person, as a Black person, and see what I mean… ATL on those Cali vibes 👌

Riling up a white, neoliberal base to target a woman of color activist IS anti-Asian violence and white supremacy in action.

Fuck @KoretzforLA and all these Right-wing Democrats who continue to show that they’re the enemy of working class Angelenos. Oh sure. CPAC organizer Matt Schlapp says he &amp; Laura Ingraham went “undercover” and joined the Black Lives Matter demonstration in DC on May 31, 2020. He claims dozens of police officers &amp; Secret Service agents were “seriously injured” but “you’ll never read or hear about that”. https://t.co/0v4HCtXMja That sweet pump 💪🏾 Great day so far 👌🏾 https://t.co/QcZ5jW0uHL This sounds like something @spookishmommy &amp; @SadieHartmann would say. of course homelander's a fuckin psycho. he drinks MILK.

Ngl whenever a white person used the word “exotic”, I get ready just in case I gotta get out of there quickly If you love cars so much why don’t you marry them “I think that the well-being of moms is a bellwether for the well-being of society, in general.

Her success is no mistake. No child should ever die from a gun. The fact that guns are the leading cause of death for children in the United States is horrific and soul crushing.

It’ll be interesting to see what Goodell does if the ban comes down at 4-8 games, which is being reported and seems pretty light. Look what MLB did with Trevor Bauer. Hence why the most frequent threat from tropical cyclones isn’t their hurricane force winds or storm surge like the Gulf States, but for their remnants to bring dry t-storms up the coast during the dry season.

2022-02-18,"Dear NFT friends, 

I am very excited to announce to you that I was approved to become a creator in @cryptocom

This is a breakthrough and big milestone for me to be part of this industry. I need your advise my fellow creators. 
#NFTs #nftcreator #NFTart #cryptocom https://t.co/cpICQSVlJk @scrit_ anthony fantanto really ruined these kids man😭 @pygmalionundone I tweeted, but like a Viking👊🏽 Do you think that if this taxi had hit a cop, the driver wouldn’t be in jail? The problem isn’t that this case can’t be solved. The Hardy Boys could solve it within the covers of one book. It’s that the 108th doesn’t care about it. The TLC can identify all the taxis shown on GPS within a few blocks of here at this time, and knows who was driving them. At maximum, 10 of those will match make and model and have medallion numbers matching the blurry number in the image. (More likely, one or two.) Any Law &amp; Order writer can describe the one hour of elementary police work necessary to identify roughly ten (10) suspects, one of whom definitely committed this vehicular assault. I guess the 108th is too busy sitting in their cars outside Duane Reade? https://t.co/OazGAccGSa OMG!!!

Haha — i meant to say “a very LA vibe” - of course, i had to step over a few homeless people lounging across the sidewalk and got whammed by a gal who lost control of her rental street scooter, but i guess that made this short visit *extra* downtown LA, huh? Wow. True resilience. Having worked with a lot of this type of person, a thing I’ve said for a long time is: they absolutely have *something*, but it’s not what people tend to think. It’s not that they’re brilliantly original, strategically savvy, or even (usually) great engineers or technologists. New collab!

I feel events nowadays are seeing artists not as one of the main draws to their event but as another way to make a quick buck. On top of this, ALA sells badges to attendees &gt;&gt; Logistically speaking - how do you simultaneously have an event IRL &amp; in the Metaverse? 

How do you manage it while also hosting a IRL event? Love this cool design feature and usage!

Searching the undigitized microfilm at the U of M library, it would’ve taken me weeks to find these. People are 3 dimensional. when each of us dies, I’m sure depending on the person, many things will be said about us. Even if I wasn’t a fan of someone, I wouldn’t tweet certain things. #peoplesuck The homie Judnikki (who deleted her twitter ☹️) posted that the reason people hate small talk is they just talk about themselves. That is soo true it’s either resume, boast, shit talk, life story ORR bad basic interview questions Or boundary pushing fake intimacy it’s the worst @elvintur @RealOliverArts @lewisjwr Damn why is Kristen Stewart catching strays, she has nothing to do with this 😭 wish me luck https://t.co/9F5D1g4CZE noticed today that my music’s been added to over a million Spotify playlists. i cross-checked with my team, and they have verified that this is indeed pretty gnarly number.

#RLCS are you ready? ⚽🚗 https://t.co/C0q4U2GbwK @JohnHorse19 @lesthetedufoot @ESPNNBA In that case, I’m sure you find LBJ winning the chip in 2016 overrated and don’t respect it because the Warriors choked. 🤡 White old men are terrible for this country @Jim_Jordan Correction and Congressmen What is going on with Stephon Gilmore? It’s been so quiet on that front. It’s actually rly crazy to think how we live like this LOL https://t.co/78BTPUNJZ8 i’m my own soulmate 💘 https://t.co/YC0kyYjliz So rad! “Can I get your autograph?” While I casually slide over a marriage license 🤓 People boycotting Disney but going to Miami on spring break. Babe the call is coming from inside the house. Some enby fembois can still get it tho. I feel like I’m one of the few trans girls who became significantly LESS interested in men after starting progesterone. Like, HRT erased any even mild curiosity. Another failed Trump business attempt on the way. Don Jr. plans to launch a news aggregation app to compete with Apple News and Google News. Good luck with that.

Who pays the artist? ☹️ @MarshaBlackburn You will not steal our joy. The people of the great state of Tennessee deserve better representation. Being vulnerable these are my frequently used emojis now https://t.co/YygfDOhPbs Mark Pomerantz, former senior prosecutor with Manhattan DA’s Office: Donald Trump is “guilty of numerous felony violations. The team that has been investigating Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes- he did”. And that team is still investigating Trump. @janae_brittney @sadendya Yes! The fact we pause movies/shows to discuss in depth the camera angles, lighting, set design, and continuity of scenes is pure gold. ✨ And I never have to explain WHY I absolutely need to stop the car for an immediate photo. 🥰 New office views 🎸 @sonymusic https://t.co/QWa4aSCthd NIGHT ONE AT THE FORUM WITH THESE BEAUTIES 🌕 let’s do it again tonight❤️‍🔥 #futurenostalgiatour https://t.co/a0TtwHQ4lT Ted Cruz being Ted Cruz.

Can you? I personally do not like a Adams and Acosta midfield Imagine if you didn’t know this was a feature omg I would be screaming You’re Canadian, you’re a coward who left Texas  cuz it got cold, you’re a pussy who let Trump call your wife “ugly.” And said your Dad killed Kennedy, But the one thing you are not, and have never been, @tedcruz is a “Man” When all the boys show up to the function in the J.

Serious question. Do any of you know how the internet works? Like how does an email go from me in California to someone in Europe? I think I’m gonna blow your fucking mind Hahahahahahaha!!!!! Holy shite @MarshaBlackburn ARE YOU SERIOUS?!!! Any Crusty Buttplug has ZERO JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE, and Cravenaugh is a boofing predator! Are you serious?  Put on the court for ONLY political reasons. GTFOH. Also, why are there not enough managers? So many great artists looking for representation with nurture and care. Join before April 1st 🌸💜✨️

https://t.co/tGHA2Jp7s1 https://t.co/cY8WVxTGOC @Jim_Jordan Make senators qualified and educated again. @CAgovernor So a household get up to $800 but a person who doesn't own a car and walks to work can't even get a new pair of shoes? 

Do a better job, man. Breaking news: I write more than just about pop and Latin music

Pleasure chatting with Deryck about Heaven &amp; Hell. The timing is perfect for this record Why are Judges Kavanaugh and Jackson being treated to comparable suspicion by the Senate?

One was credibly accused of rape. 

The other is a successful, supremely-qualified Black woman in America. 

No, that’s it. Those are the reasons. i’ve toured in a prius and slept in the car the whole time OH WORD 👀

You engage in processes that sideline those with the most information to remain near your benefactors. 6/6 The irony is thick because, on the same morning, you agreed to rename the park; in closed session, you also decided to criminalize the same Angelenos General Jeff’s leadership stood for. You moved forward with a legal settlement that’s nothing short of a PR stunt. 5/6 but more importantly, we demand you stop running from your constituents and do as General Jeff did, stand tall and deliver the things that the least of thee needs most. But that type of leadership is just not in you. 4/6 time you attempt to use us as such; indigenous Skid Row leadership is fierce and non-compromising, as illustrated in the case of the two neighborhood council fights, the first led by LA CAN and the second ongoing fight led by General Jeff, Katherine McNenny, and many other’s; 3/6 The renaming of Gladys Park to General Jeff Park is more a reframing of the narrative: Black people want housing and services and will fight for them; Skid Row is a destination worthy of investment and care; we are not political toys and will rise and rebel every 2/6 At a time when leadership is abundantly absent in City Hall, it feels good to converse about and memorialize someone who represented the culture, his community, his people, and our collective interests. 1/6 9 days left!

River Cracraft played the past eight games as a core special-teams contributor. But the #49ers determined they could not have both Trenton Cannon and Cracraft among the 48 players to suit up tomorrow. @moto_kula @AllThingsDante Which makes it classist because certain groups get that lesson mroe than others. Putting the burden of closing the wage gap on uninformed people instead of paying what the position is worth is going away slowly but surely. #24 @HarvardMTennis beats #15 Pepperdine 4-3, winning the doubles point and earning wins in singles at #2, #3, and #5. Brian Shi won 76 57 64 to clinch at #3.

Humbled to have had the time to sit down with @ChrisVanVliet and talk comedy, wrestling, and how Back to the Future is the most perfect movie of all time. Don’t @ me Just wanted to follow up: You’re right to highlight the performances. None of this works without the heart, the emotion that Jim brought out from all the actors. Watching them during filming was raw theatre. There should be more noise about this. Not all wrestlers can be comedians.. but all comedians should not be wrestlers. 

@RonFunches is the only exception I will hear of this. @ACatWithNews @kdeleon is a racist who surrounds himself with racists.

This is who KDL is. It seeps into everything he does from appointments like Jose Gutierrez, to policies like 41.18, to physical violence on those who hold him accountable.

KDL must go. @emschumacher Sometimes I find it hard to hold back. The lady was badgering the other one “in the name of Jesus” and just nope.

Such a dope interaction. Sorry, but so many of the attacks on Kyrsten Sinema focus on her appearance. I don’t hate her because of how she looks or dresses. I hate her because she just singlehandedly sold out democracy. Hello! https://t.co/ta6dze2PWj The filibuster or 60 vote requirement are constantly dispensed with-unless it’s something the GOP doesn’t want changed. Then it’s a violation of “Senate tradition.”

No offense, but preserving the vote is more important than tradition.

I can’t fathom how any Senator, of either party, can’t be for the protection of voting rights. But a Democrat who won’t do ANYTHING to protect them? That is unconscionable. It might feel very high and mighty for Kyrsten Sinema to know that she alone can kill or pass significant legislation. But her ego is playing with fire and just might usher in the end of American democracy. Kevin McCarthy wants to lead a legislative body while simultaneously refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of that body’s investigatory committees.

One loved the comedy and dubbed it, affectionately, a “dramedy paced like an action film.”

The other said it was a “slow burn” and wished it was “just a drama.”

Constant lesson — find the people your script speaks to. Okay, World: When was the last time you saw a Saab 900 in this rare five-door hatch form? It’s been many, many years for me.

Should be a big box-office weekend  for it. @Cernovich @MisesCaucusCT These are great reasons that resonate with me.

Woman’s rights are human rights. Lmfao this lady being racist asl to a group of Asian tourists. I sho did yell across the metro for her to shut her ass up. And Ig she wasn’t expecting someone to call her out cause bestie sure did stfu What I want is women to have economically viable paths to not sustain these kinds of self inflicted hauntings the rest of their lives. They protest because they think abortion is their first line of defense and it’s not at all a primary means of birth control. It’s traumatic. I had an abortion at 42, an accidental pregnancy. I already had two children. To think that I would not have had the choice to end that pregnancy is unfathomable. And now, to talk to my 11-year-old daughter about her body, her rights is incredibly sad, difficult, terrifying. Hey all. Just wanted to let everyone know I just tested positive for covid. I feel fine, but was hanging out with a lot of people this past week and wanted to let you all know. 😞
 
I’m truly sorry if you caught it from me and I wish everyone affected a speedy recovery. This fucking lunatic makes Trump seem completely sane in comparison. @JoshDubowAP can you tell me why you dislike @derekcarrqb so much?! All he has done is give us his blood, sweat, and tears. And after 8 szns our front office FINALLY decides to give him the tools to make a Super Bowl run. https://t.co/yaduOMQjpQ I tried to have a lil Baywatch moment but ended up less than graceful 😂 https://t.co/dExlCTQjAO If you zoom out a bit, mass protesting for removal of all inconveniences for ending life looks like collective unresolved trauma display. I don’t think you’re going to hell. Trauma is an invitation to not persist in the same behavioral trap that created the wound on parade. Heal! Nobody’s saying that voting doesn’t help, we’re saying that if the people we vote for are just gonna tell us to vote without ever DOING ANYTHING, then what is even the point? OBSERVE EVERYTHING https://t.co/GMvnhWNDAL @TristanSnell Why would anyone need IVF if you have an entire group of fertile females you’ve just made non-citizens. Just use one of them. We had the delusion we were at least equal citizens if not equal earners. The SC just reminded us we absolutely are not. #BlueVoices 4 weeks clean from perico &amp; I’m so proud of myself 🥹 Thank you to the whole Daytime community and fanbase for the support!

RIP Mavis Nicholson 💕 https://t.co/K2wOqheOCm it’s literally raining which means perfect weather to be cuddled up w my nonexistent bf A special message from @ale_jara63 and I. And Avery and Cooper. And many more players that we can’t announce just yet but who will definitely eat away at your entire soul. (Sound on…but also maybe not?) https://t.co/9NZNRA5DgD Don’t think the Queen was a bad person but she wasn’t great or good even. Just a moderate head of a useless and archaic institution. At some point this century I’m hoping all monarchies can be in the dustbin of history. Trump shoots down idea of Ivanka being his running mate. It was a silly question. He doesn’t want to run for office with her, he wants to date her. https://t.co/jNUZ4sreBW At Taco Bell earlier I tried ordering a “Blaja Bast” and then I laughed so hard at my fumble as an ad popped up on the menu screen for “Mexican pizza, the musical”. What a day! What a life. Come hang with us at the #BigNate bus event this Sunday at the @SantaMonicaPier! See you there 😎🧡  https://t.co/yTaUbxNIFF A kid approached me in my comfortable grass bed and asked me “are you a 5th grader or are you a grown up?” - I was like … I actually don’t know I’d pay money to see Trump and Biden sitting at the funeral like the two old men on The Muppets. @SWaallise7 @nyn1nafo Pretty sure Andropov flew Jello Biafra to the USSR to help the Dead Kennedys write Plastic Surgery Disasters too.

Gorbachev funded George Carlin’s stand up which led me to become a leftist in the early 90s. that moment when I couldn’t get my shirt off at @PlaylistLive 😂 @curmudgeon44039 Comfort food, cooler weather, and Trader Joe’s pumpkin spice coffee (don’t @ me, pumpkin spice haters). 🙄 “SHOCKER” … Duh, because men act like they are so overwhelmed, can’t multitask, can’t manage their time, or be emotionally supportive. For men, it’s about THEM (them as individuals). For women, it’s about US (us as an entire family). A lot of sticks in our first blue vs. gold challenge of the season! 🙌

Did some excellent planespotting on my New Year’s Day bike ride ✈️ #avgeek @flyLAXairport https://t.co/KUOX2PT4kB This is a tip that might have made sense in the days before digital recording and autotranscription, but not now.  Time consumed is almost zero, and there are better ways of avoiding overreliance on quotes in your writing, like developing a trusted relationship with your editor. This is an actual tweet 😅 https://t.co/7AeusugwZt You know it's a hit when the animals start vibing!

Only one of those exists and it’s called Sierra Madre, CA Our campaign isn’t just another vote on the City Council. We intend to fight to move policy forward that leaves no one behind and moves money and resources into our communities. Help us get there by donating today at https://t.co/sprf48TAHO #CD1 #ForThePeopleofLA LA is the epicenter of the housing crisis. I will do everything I can to keep Angelenos housed &amp; ensure that if you work in LA you can live in LA

-Strengthen renter protections
-Build deeply affordable housing
-Meet housing needs of ppl facing homelessness #CD1 #ForthepeopleofLA https://t.co/T95wBnb0YD Are we surprised that the comedian that likely murdered his wife is also a gutless coward? All sweeps of houseless encampments must be paused while the Homeless Count is ongoing. If we are to get out of this crisis we need to know the true numbers and house to scale. 

We need deeply deeply affordable housing. This luxury housing has done nothing for our ppl.
#CD1 https://t.co/Ip59NxVLqT Not only is displacement dangerous while Omicron surges, but it will also lead to an undercount of the number of ppl unhoused in #CD1. It paints a false assessment of the neighborhoods that truly need tremendous amounts of resources. https://t.co/3guAMuvFkv We won’t overcome this houselessness crisis until the city both houses and builds at the rate that ppl are becoming unhoused, and the new housing built is 

*actually affordable to the residents and workers of those neighborhoods*. 

Can you afford to live in Los Angeles? #CD1 https://t.co/fJEiA7TGQv 4 days into the new year and there is already a sweep scheduled for tomorrow morning 1/4 at MacArthur Park in #CD1 https://t.co/00dcFKnmqA Last day in the city https://t.co/bEtm5utCbK wahlburgers on sunset plaza is dunzo— fuck that place!

The losers — working class people of all countries involved whose lives will be sacrificed and communities shattered.

How about more action and less awareness please? 🙏🏼 They were programs that look A+ on social media and seemingly did all the right things. But here I am, still trying to undo the harm they caused quite a few years later and I know I’m far from alone. A “HAES” program told everyone to have 2 scoops of🍦but told me to get a kiddie scoop.A HAES program made me measure+weigh every bite I consumed like I was on WW.A HAES program was where a counselor grabbed snack from my hand&amp;told me it was too much(even though i measured it 🤦🏻‍♀️). It’s honestly devastating to watch ED organizations &amp; treatment centers pretending to care about all sufferers on social media while continuing to cater to thin, white girls. We don’t want platitudes. We want ACTION taken. I don’t want eating disorder awareness week. I want eating disorder action week. Here's another one from yesterdays flight.

Some days are bad for no apparent reason. This message from @ericleer is a bright spot on a dark day. Of course, I’m deeply sorry that Margaret crossed over. But gratified and proud of Molly. Her spirit was too big and powerful for her small body. Its sad how no matter how many Mexican players go to Europe u seem to focus on US players I like bad bitches, too, she can be bae
Ass fat to the max like TJ
BJ while he speedin' on the freeway #FaveFreakyBar #NickiVMAs @ericleer Beautiful Margaret. I am so sorry to learn of her passing, but deeply gratified to know that she’ll be with Molly. I know that when we call on someone in spirit, especially Molly, those calls do not go unanswered. Molly was there to greet her. This brings joy to my sad heart. Great wins last night for Northview and Monrovia.  Road wins against solid teams. @KayeSteinsapir This is true. Thank God for the 1%.

Just one more NYT news piece pointing out that Donald Trump is a piece of shit hypocrite. That ought to do it.

I respect so much when a creative really dives into their fantasy and craft. Creating not to make money , but make money in order to actualize your imagination and vision . That’s how I live 🎀💞 Tucker mocked Chapo, and Breitbart admits they are disarming even though their ideology is not at all aligned with Breitbart’s. Are you high. Didn’t say a single thing about liberals, and I’d never say they’re worse than the far right, because it’s not something I believe, so I truly do not know what this person is talking about. https://t.co/grK6mnikNJ So the best way to “support” black people is for white people to NOT see Wakanda Forever opening weekend - which would make it the biggest flop in Marvel history.

This is literally “get woke, go broke” racism.

https://t.co/DWwyPeWNNm now this just funny 😹 Skechers confirms they had Kanye West escorted out of their Los Angeles headquarters after West “showed up unannounced and uninvited”. Skechers: “We condemn his divisive remarks &amp; do not tolerate antisemitism or any form of hate speech. We have no intention of working with West.” https://t.co/mqjGIx7djn Excited to spend Friday evening with the students over at @UCSCGame! I’m a huge fan of many designers from their programs.

Denial of facts makes for sketchy medicine. If you were taking a US History class &amp; read that a president refused to concede the election, tried to have state delegations thrown out, threatened to seize voting machines, then directed a violent insurrection on the Capitol, would you believe this happened w/o repercussion? I spent the last four weeks in LA area.

Join me soon, be ready to invest, and let's plant the beet together. Restaurants and platforms do a bad job of leaving people on their own while taking all their talent to enrich themselves. beet will be doing the opposite and we will fight for each other along the way. Soon, you will see a build out on my site and opportunities to hear the pitch for beet (codename) where you can sign up, listen, and choose to invest at our pre-seed level. Creating a platform of this magnitude will be a massive undertaking and will be less software as a service and more software with a service. The intention is to pair tech with experts and people to maximize efficiency to push dreams forward. This will allow for more people to be heard and paid along with the ability for fans and supporters to buy into the peeps they're most excited about and discover new peeps along the way. We will help people position themselves to take their creations from ideas to market and beyond by helping them skip the unnecessary steps and gatekeeping associated within the industry. Will be launching a start-up soon that will shift the way content is created by chefs, cooks, and fans of cooking by giving them more control and pay with multiple revenue streams and guidance. https://t.co/Gsl45QOJKp The e-tron GT has a nasty road presence 🥵 https://t.co/LNI1lkBvi0 Damn, this koffee verse too filthy😮‍💨 Likewise!

There has to be a better way. Also, this isn’t a good look for whatever VC firm takes this approach. Just got TKO’d by a box of gourmet donuts. And for those of you who were wondering, who was holding this offense back…well you got your answer today. Nathaniel Hackett.

That said, does that absolve Russell Wilson from any blame? No but Nathaniel Hackett shoulders the brunt of it in my opinion. Today is day 4 with no talking- in an attempt to repair my vocal cords. This no-talking business has been a very interesting experience. I been doing a lot of introspection. “Yeah I got to meet them. I’m a fan, and I’ve been for a while.

What an unnecessary and ridiculous thing to be taught. I used Venmo for some talong from our Filipino farmer at the farmer’s market and used the 🍆 emoji as the memo. Then I thought, how often is that one used for actual eggplants? Death, Taxes, and Suburban parents saying “there’s nothing wrong with that!” when a 17 year old tells them they’re going to community college in the fall. Defending homeland?

I would hope to speak with her on Kingian Nonviolence as a formal philosophy and see if she sees a central place for it in today's antiracism - and if not why. This is why King would have had sympathy for much of the grievances of the modern antiracist movement. Not enough has changed to make them irrelevant.

But King's philosophy of Nonviolence &amp; rejection of Black Power consciousness does make him different from NHJ &amp; others. 40 minute drive, Super Gremlin plays on repeat for all 40 minutes Tune in to see Kings try and prevent Meier from being just the 9th player ever to score 6+ in a NHL game.

Welcome to the family man 😵🛹 

Only 8 pieces now remain : https://t.co/beDKSq1mFD https://t.co/RoVv23laGX Taking note of all the people saying mole is gross 🤨 Matt Lingo is going to Cannes @martinweiss Reminds me of that Kat Williams bit https://t.co/X1OwWzCpe7 Still in love with these, my @foundation pieces are still fun https://t.co/RmuJUYqcjR and then I see that he has blocked me.

the man contacted ME just to tell me he thought of me while he was with HIS WIFE ON THEIR HONEYMOON BLOCKED ME. 

all of this to say: he’s a Capricorn and my ass knows fucking better but here we are. 😂😂😂😂 Yesterday, the subway shooting in Brooklyn happened &amp; I know he and his family live near by and take the train daily. I send him a quick message via snapchat “Hey. are you and your family safe?” last week a gig flew me out to NYC again. in the days leading up to it I thought about reaching out. I didn’t. I knew that I’d be disrespecting his marriage and should leave the reaching out to him. so I have dinner with a friend instead and head back to LA. We talk for about 30 more minutes. reminiscing. telling each other sweet things that teetered on inappropriate but never really crossed a line. I didn’t bother to ask about his wife and he didn’t bring her up again. we hang up and I feel dizzy by the whiplash of emotions. he tells me he was just in LA. he rented a car and drove all over town. said he saw my city through my eyes &amp; thought of me the whole time. WHY DIDN’T YOU CALL?! I demanded. to which he replied “we were on our honey moon”

Oh. I say. trying not to let my voice shake or crack. a few months ago I get a message via Snapchat. it’s him responding to a selfie. I’m fucking excited. I no longer have a minimum wage job and can afford to go see him if he’d like. I tell him about being NYC &amp; he asks why I didn’t reach out. I explain I was respecting his boundary in 2019 I went to NYC for the first time on a book tour. I was there for 10 days and thought of him every day. I had my column then and wrote about missing him in it. I came back to LA, went about my life. the pandemic landed like a shit storm &amp; I was occupied with staying alive. we’d lose touch but we’d always make our way back to each other. we had the kind of intimacy you develop when all you can share is conversation. we really loved each other. it was beautiful and painful. around 2018 he disappeared on me. I figured he moved in with his newest gf. story: a guy and I fell in love over 10 yrs ago. I was catfishing him. I eventually confessed. we continued talking via Skype nightly for a couple of yrs. we couldn’t travel to each other &amp; agreed long distance ached too much. eventually we began dating other folks. wait are you sure you want me to be in charge of nukes

Much love to the EIC’s during my time at The Star: @sundevilg and Cassandra Nava, as well as former Sports Editor Stephen Castaneda and our Advisor @ProfDauber. With Los Angeles Valley College’s graduation being tomorrow, my time as Sports Editor with @ValleyStarNews has come to a close.

The past year and a half has been a wonderful experience with The Star and has provided me the tools for success at UCLA and hopefully the @DailyBruin. Rest easy knowing there’s so many taxpayer funded, lab mutated diseases ready to go to force the agenda your way!! I remember liking this goal till I was a hostage in the methodology to get there.

Is it minority states rights? Individual rights constraining the state? Free speech? The right to self protection? That our army can’t commandeer our homes? Another actor asked me “so do you love LA” and I’m a terrible liar so I said “yeah, today, I love LA!”

My heart is breaking all over again…those poor children…fuck man…everything I learn about Uvalde, Texas breaks me. @tombogert He has a point tho, MLS site is bias with their ratings Every Proud Boy I’ve met is either a Veteran who has served our nation, or a blue collar man’s man that uses their back and hands to help hold this country together.

Every Antifa member I’ve met is a useless, opinionated slob that contributes nothing to society. Going to print several of my nudes and sell them at the Rose Bowl Flea Market Your time is coming, Stay Patient. I haven’t fully grasped that I have 2 major production of my play next year in 2023.

Whewwww… Mainstream media can’t mention the Proud Boys without referring to them as a “far right extremist group,” and yet all references to Antifa - responsible for setting entire cities ablaze - have only been referred to as “mostly peaceful protestors.”

Make it make sense. I’m really proud to graduate this week from my dream school with summa cum laude, the 2022 Chancellor’s Service Award, and the Hillel at UCLA Netzach award for enduring leadership! @UCLA @UCLAchancellor @HillelIntl https://t.co/8BWGN2haII So fire.

You seen how they talk about Bam? You could say “I bet Bam likes McDonald’s” and they’ll go “Yeah but Pascal probably finishes all his fries.” 

It usually doesn’t even make sense. SparkToro: 70% of Elon Musk’s followers on Twitter are spam, fake, or inactive. The average Twitter user has fewer than 10% fake or spam accounts. WSJ: “Musk’s prominence and interaction with other users, as well as the topics he tweets about, make him a magnet for spam.” https://t.co/ZMYhz6u2yu Let's just allow grenades to be carried everywhere. So when a mass shooter opens up you can duck behind a desk car, table, lamp post, or pew and lob one at shooter. Since dozens will die anyway.

It’s a very important topic to me. 

A friend asked me a similar question last week. My answer: We’re already here. You’re already here. This is YOUR time. OUR time. 

I’m glad you’re here. Today is a sad day in LA. Racist comments (and slurs directed at gay council members) by city leaders are unacceptable and abhorrent and heighten divisions rather than bring our communities together. (Continued). “What do you mean Title Fight tickets are sold out?” The D.O.C. spoke to the Cowboys last night. Gave them an inspirational message pregame message, per Mike McCarthy

- Don't track planes
- Lane Kiffin, Urban Meyer, Matt Campbell, &amp; Luke Fickell will be message board candidates 
- Support the players and make Lincoln the #1 destination for a great coach Today is a day to remember the immense unity and compassion shown to one another in the wake of tragedy on 9/11.

🗣 THE GAME IS WON IN THE TRENCHES — NOT THE PERIMETER!!!

#Raiders Khalil Mack with his 3rd sack (and what should have been probably the 5th hold against him) of the game. Well worth a 2nd and a 5th…@LAFBNetwork #Chargers pass rushers today:
Khalil Mack 6 tackles, 3 tackles for loss, and 3 sacks
Joey Bosa 3 tackles, 1 tackles for loss, and 1.5 sacks
#LVvsLAC Oline is a Problem yall What is going on @packers Congratulations to the @Dodgers for the tenth straight year of moving forward into the playoff season!! First team to lock in!! #ITFDB Khalil Mack sacks Derek Carr on 4th down. That is his third sack of the game and should finish this out.

Happy Saturday everyone 🤝 I lost $20,000 in a competition against cis women. A cis woman with height advantages. That’s a missed opportunity for me as a woman.

But, I hear no complaints about the opportunities taken away from trans women when we lose. Which as a whole is more often then not. @CarlaEsparza1 brings up “recent studies” she says prove that trans women have an advantage even after 2 years of HRT.

But it's fairly easy, frankly. I think this is a good shorthand for what are usually a straightforward set of choices for most elections. Interesting that none of this was revealed after he became prime minister but before the 2019 election. It's almost like the British media decided to roll over to ensure Boris Johnson won the election to stop Jeremy Corbyn.

He cussed out the staff cause they wouldn’t accept his coupon and was asked to leave. 😬 Elon is a fraud. He’s made billions of dollars off of the hordes of our tax dollars paying for electric car subsidies he gets to pocket. He’s an overload clown and power drunk like all politicians and corporate oligarchs. He ain’t your friend, he acts purely out of self interest. “We can’t lose this election because of the rain.

A lotta word vomit since this podcast ep helped me articulate a lot of what I’ve been feeling for most of my career in animation. This is why we need a #NewDeal4Animation - because we all deserve far better working conditions than we have right now. (8/8) I’ve been off work since February and I’m really nervous about starting back up in July - I feel lucky I’m going to be working under a great AD/one of my closest friends, but I’m also wondering how much longer I have it in me to keep up with this cycle. (7/8) Add in the onslaught of projects getting cancelled, and that takes our cynicism and metastasizes it. We’re vying for a shrinking number of jobs in an increasingly volatile studio climate. (6/8) If we’re failing and feel alone in that failure, we start to resent our coworkers who we perceive to be succeeding in ways we aren’t, making us feel threatened about job security - in an industry wherein job insecurity/unemployment is built into most of our careers. (5/8) Once we’re already exhausted, we start becoming harder on ourselves for not meeting a standard of work we’d like to be at, either imposed by our productions or ones we place on ourselves. This leads us to feel like we’re constantly failing at our jobs. (4/8) Looking at the big picture of the industry, budgets and schedules are getting slashed. That means more work in less time - easily leading to exhaustion. The volume of work demands far more of our mental and emotional energy than can be replenished outside of work. (3/8) 1. mental fatigue and emotional exhaustion ✅
2. depersonalization and cynicism ✅
3. lowered sense of personal accomplishment ✅

They note that different professions feel each of these differently due to the nature of their jobs. (2/8) I was just listening to a podcast citing three signs of burnout one of the leading social psychology researchers of burnout, Christina Maslach.

Reader: I don’t know anyone in the animation industry that *doesn’t* suffer from at least one or two of them.

I know a lot of you are tired of seeing tweets about 10-year old girls being raped &amp; getting abortions. And I’m sorry it’s triggering or irritating. Sadly, with how things are going, this is where we’re headed. These stories will become the norm. We can’t allow that. hearing someone who holds an insomniac passport call the underground scene a ""fake rave"" was probably the funniest shit i heard today 😂 didn’t want to put this on insta, BUT also you have to be an absolutely depraved perv who can dirty talk a blue streak with me. send me sexts that make me blush and/or jaw drop and i’m all yours. Why does @Chris_Meloni continues to challenge my virtue and morals? I thought this was Eric Davis at first! 😂 First stop in LA is @ScottRogowsky’s vintage clothes spot.

The only thing I would add to what you wrote is that the enemy isn't ""Russia"" but the gangster Putin and his KGB thugs who've hijacked it. He's very much the fault of the wealthy capitalists who've appeased him over the years and not the fault of Russian citizens. @blakkat41 So is my whole family, genius, but when we go to a restaurant here in L.A., we have to wear masks and show our proof of vaccination. anyone else get so many spam calls they have to put their phone on dnd 😭 Saw the Afghanistan pullout thru @yamphoto’s lens &amp; felt as if I was there along side him.

I am sad that he has been called to action by another conflict, but thankful to have his unique perspective on the ground w/  @latimesphotos

#RestoreTheSnyderVerse https://t.co/5XweJRwsDl Great example of this shit. Pisses me off. 

https://t.co/2bnzmEluQd I absolutely cannot stand people who adopt because they have some stupid political agenda or they want to make themselves look virtuous. This is a person who complains about virtue signaling while holding a sign that says that they are more virtuous than mothers who abort. Not to mention that this is something said with such little thought. Adoption is an expensive and long process and there are so many children who are currently in foster care. If you gave a fuck it wouldn't take the repeal of roe v Wade for you to adopt children in need. https://t.co/IBkB5G2smT Responding to every client “just following up” email with “omg why are you literally so obsessed with me ew” The kitties are bird watching https://t.co/hDSkeanY7a FEVER DREAM is pinky up. @aarra98 This is kind of a cop out answer, but I'd actually like to see our VALORANT agents fleshed out more.

Me &amp; who 🥺🥺🥺🥺 https://t.co/YUe1reypiT As a black transgender adoptee I know for a fact these people would not have adopted me and if they did I probably would be living with the trauma to this day. People who do shit like this would have never looked at children like me as possible options for adoption without agenda random kpop fan: do u want me to take ur picture

me: no this is my thing https://t.co/edlxdMCpp0 One of the main things I’ve learned as an accountant in the music industry, people closest to the artist have NO problem stealing from them and act like we don’t notice through the bank statements we get on the daily…lmao @UberFacts Cat people have the intellect to understand cats. Knuckle-draggers are better suited for dogs. @sebaldodeweert I'm a black transgender adoptee and everything from your Twitter presence tells me that you would have never adopted me. I specifically hate this phrase because when you examine who actually gets adopted you realize how few people are willing to adopt all of these children. Got my first (gifted) brand collab today!

Community first. 
Love first, always References are a hot debate now in this space. For me- I choose to never use other illustrations for inspiration. Images I utilized were transformed into something completely unique to my aesthetic. 

I mean, look at me 😂 I basically throw up stardust on anything I touch Orange linework, limited color palette, &amp; design elements that seemed to sprout within the Stardust ecosystem. 

⏩to 4 months ago- the generative, &amp; coming into my own as an illustrator (sans references) 

Still, budding artists should know the tools we used while learning 🙏🏼 https://t.co/iVEZ5zdB8N really feeling the despair after a weekend of processing and being angry.. When I started the genesis collection, I was teaching myself how to illustrate digitally at the same time. I loved finding references inspired by retro fashion models.

A Good Day. I hate how often this still happens. Today is a time more than ever the people are getting tired of the “americanized/cartoony“ versions of accents, yet almost to a T, every time an authentically-accented actor is hired, it’s the same stock response. “IT’S SO FAKE” &gt;:T Villanueva cites what he calls the Pottery Barn rule “you break it, you own it.” @RMac18 @kateconger @MikeIsaac Elon is the original snowflake Still haven't forgotten how you're charging artists more than AX does for an artist table (despite having a fraction of the attendees). Which is why I won't be in the lineup next year.

Much love to @jeffcoleart @markbrazil and the entire @metarelics and @Shopify teams for having us. https://t.co/pxYXsyACq7 @MarkSerreze We don't know! But of the baryons, the proton is the lightest, so it can't decay into another. @TAndersen_nSCIr They haven't been observed decaying, that doesn't mean they absolutely don't. And it doesn't mean they absolutely do either. That is so close to the Observatory, hope it doesn’t catch fire, such a landmark in LA. https://t.co/qQjsBM5wdw It is amazing just how horrifically freakish most politicians are these days 😱 Since several people have asked: if protons do decay, they'll decay into smaller particles, like for example a quark-antiquark pair (this is called a ""meson"") plus a positron. #LAFD #PIO in route with an arrival time at 4 PM.

She chose something dearer than being part of the House Republican caucus. Her integrity. 

Kevin McCarthy &amp; many of others could have made the same choice. In honor of Latino Heritage Month, Rafael Belmar Osuna had the chance to speak about his experiences on the team during the 1983-85 seasons. 

He also shared about his uncle, Rafael Osuna who was the first Mexican world champion in doubles at Wimbledon (1960). https://t.co/DKvrOcWcz7 Nancy Pelosi is extraordinary.

These are common sense measures to protect each other— including the most vulnerable.

Let’s more than hope for a better season. Let’s help minimize it. /end No matter what happens. A few things we won’t regret. 
-Getting the bivalent booster (data looks good, uptake looks bad)
-Consider getting kids (as young as 5 now) boosted esp. if they’re going to be near grandparents
-Using Paxlovid if you get sick
-Masking more during waves 13/ 2022 could be the first year of one Greek letter dominating the entire year @dr_kkjetelina tells me. (She’s on @inthebubblepod Monday.) 12/ What’s the other 20%? 

It’s scientists giving themselves room that there’s something we aren’t seeing with our current, weakened global surveillance &amp; genetic testing.

That a more troublesome new Greek letter is out there somewhere mutating. 11/ And if we do have ladder-progression, small incremental variants and many of them co-circulating, it could represent what an endemic state could be like.

Experts I have talked to rate a scenario like this at 80% or so likelihood. 10/ Once concern is with each variant we need to ask how our stable of drugs and vaccines hold up. And at least against one of the variants (BA.4.6 if you’re keeping score), Evushield doesn’t appear to hold up. 

Against others the monoclonals don’t do as well. 9/ If this is what indeed happens— multiple marginal variables— it could feel quite manageable if people avail themselves of boosters, Paxlovid if they get ill &amp; are at risk &amp; Evushield* if they are immune compromised. (*see next tweet) 8/ And there is a high likelihood, even with light or modest changes in variants, that there will be an uptick in respiratory diseases like COVID. And coinciding with the flu. 7/ The rise in cases in Europe don’t appear to be variant-related but seasonal.

Here in the US, cases are still dropping but plateauing in some places. Wastewater is telling us we may be on the verge of seeing cases begin to rise in the Northeast. 6/"

Yo the ones posting their photos.. I have no words. The production strictly said not to leak photos before tonight's airing! Be classy and act classy for once. “The Bexar County Sheriff’s Office has opened an investigation into the migrants that were lured from the Migrant Resource Center, located in Bexar County, TX, and flown to Florida, where they were ultimately left to fend for themselves in Martha’s Vineyard, MA,” I CAN'T SAY I CAN DIE NOW.

a quick summary:
I’m not sure.
I don’t remember.
I don’t have any details.
I can’t speak on this. “By saving solar, we’ll put our state on the right track towards a clean energy future and help everyone enjoy the benefits of the Sun.” #SaveSolar @GavinNewsom @californiapuc @AReynoldsCPUC https://t.co/MizoPWh82p 👕 🎄 25 Days of Christmas T-Shirts, 2022 Edition, Day 1

Maybe a bit of a ""cheat"" since I wear this shirt equally during both the Halloween and Christmas seasons. This is an homage to the cover of 1962's ""Amazing Fantasy"" #15, the debut of Spider-Man. 

#christmastshirt https://t.co/Hbc9UIzI9L Been so busy today, I nearly forgot: I’ve been promoted to Social Managing Editor at IGN!

it is the real deal but you were all right about my titties being too big, all the shirts with a zipper are tight in the chest I’d love to wake up now and walk into Londis for a breakfast roll and pretend I’ve loads to do and just tip away at nothing all day. The family who runs Ms. Donut are kind, generous members of our community in Echo Park. They are (in my colleague @Prof_NataliaM’s words), “place-makers.” It’s a shame they’re being driven out of their longtime space. Please contribute if you can. @AkilTircuit @CelticssUp @LegionHoops So you cool with the library putting the book on the shelf, you just waiting to attack the person who picks it up to read it!

Thank you to all who’ve been there with us since he fell ill. You held our arms up &amp; helped carry us through a very difficult season. @mossyzinc 3 performance-enhancing drugs, 1 illegal. Could this get any more laughable? Why does a healthy professional athlete that's 15 years old need 3 heart medications? It's such a joke and an embarrassment to the sport, Olympics, and everyone who follows the rules. Was nothing but a G thang. Let me put my bag down for a minute. #VIP https://t.co/dYZJKyYukK Love that LA is openly saying “Meh, people aren’t following the rules anyway and the rules make them mad at us, so we should just give up.” https://t.co/pYNyMZAbAE I'm pleased to announce an exciting investment opportunity, exclusively for my followers. https://t.co/VBS9ELiVco like, for why? https://t.co/EgzWrs69dm I think it’s time to do some more tarot readings for folks 🃏 DM me if you want a free reading 🤲🏾 and we can set up a time P R I O R I T I E S ___________

Does it apply to Ivy League democrats straddled with student loans they’ll never pay off? Is it an attitude? Is there a certain tax bracket? East coasters? lmao worst slides of all time Great advice on loglines from @roadmapwriters!

Even if you think 100 hour weeks are necessary, wouldn't you want to let people do them in their pajamas and with no commuting time, to the extent possible? @NPR I say that about every trump rally.

It’s about those who believe in majority rule vs those who will subvert it every way to preserve authoritarian, non-majoritarian power. 

And will use it to impose their policies on an unwilling majority.

There was mainstream consensus on the most volatile issues.

Religious &amp; gun fanaticism preclude it from happening again. We now live in 2 separate Americas. 

On civil rights, reproduction, immigration, marriage, climate change, contraception, intimacy, voting rights &amp; truth. 

The myth that we’ll ever return to the mainstream consensus of post WWII is inherently flawed. 

That was the anomaly. @unity4allkind @mojam29 @Logically_JC The economy has historically been better under democrats. There are facts and studies to back this up. It’s time to bring back prank calls.
