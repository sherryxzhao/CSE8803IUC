Gatdamn! I took mushrooms to ward off a panic attack I started having an hour ago but all they did was give it jazz hands “You need to be more respectful.” Love this. John Kirby reprimands a reporter for talking over another by reminding him where they were- the White House. All decorum and respect was lost during the Trump presidency, nice to see it return. https://t.co/FKgstsJLus This is the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen @ninjamac you promised you wouldn't tweet about me “Wow, you’re so ambitious! It feels like you’re always busy with something!”

“Thank you! I’m pretty sure it’s due to mental illness based on a desperate need for self-validation! I’m worried that if I stop I’ll die and cease to exist 🥰” Girl, this is like putting on new clothes over the clothes you are wearing right now. Well SHIT Just wrote a scene where it rains for the first time!

When the plays work they really work to the point where The Guard seem flustered some rounds.

Overall you gotta give kudos to SEN for putting in the time. Chivas fans love Chicharito.

But of the baryons, the proton is the lightest, so it can't decay into another. @TAndersen_nSCIr They haven't been observed decaying, that doesn't mean they absolutely don't. And it doesn't mean they absolutely do either. That is so close to the Observatory, hope it doesn’t catch fire, such a landmark in LA. https://t.co/qQjsBM5wdw It is amazing just how horrifically freakish most politicians are these days 😱 Since several people have asked: if protons do decay, they'll decay into smaller particles, like for example a quark-antiquark pair (this is called a ""meson"") plus a positron. #LAFD #PIO in route with an arrival time at 4 PM.

And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one.” - Tupac Shakur (1993) Thinking about the comment I made on @OgLakyn’s recent lewk and realized maybe when people are “looking me up and down,” there’s just so much good going on that they don’t know where to focus. I’ve always assumed that over it being a bad thing anyway.

This month is Latin Heritage month. Did you know that Latin folks experiencing homelessness in LA went up 26%? 

But here’s your city councilman
@kdeleon advocating for bad bunny day in LA. 🙄 

He’s sooooo “cool and hip”. 🤣 https://t.co/g7OrN7GYt5 I forgot how much I love the ""fun facts"" in GBBO: ""when he's not mixing up ganache, Lloyd likes to look through the window out into the yard for a moment or two."" Once a generation someone has an idea like this. I give you genius…. We need to stop making queer musicians My cab driver said, “my english is no so good. I only come to LA from Armenia 6 months ago. I learn English from watching YouTube.” I told him, “i’ve been trying to learn Japanese (in a not-so diligent way) for 20+ years. Your English is perfect by comparison.” 😅 Recognize!!!!

Omg. I’ve never seen her depicted this way and I don’t like it. Haha — i meant to say “a very LA vibe” - of course, i had to step over a few homeless people lounging across the sidewalk and got whammed by a gal who lost control of her rental street scooter, but i guess that made this short visit *extra* downtown LA, huh? Wow. True resilience. Having worked with a lot of this type of person, a thing I’ve said for a long time is: they absolutely have *something*, but it’s not what people tend to think. It’s not that they’re brilliantly original, strategically savvy, or even (usually) great engineers or technologists. New collab!

(Sound on…but also maybe not?) https://t.co/9NZNRA5DgD Don’t think the Queen was a bad person but she wasn’t great or good even. Just a moderate head of a useless and archaic institution. At some point this century I’m hoping all monarchies can be in the dustbin of history. Trump shoots down idea of Ivanka being his running mate. It was a silly question. He doesn’t want to run for office with her, he wants to date her. https://t.co/jNUZ4sreBW At Taco Bell earlier I tried ordering a “Blaja Bast” and then I laughed so hard at my fumble as an ad popped up on the menu screen for “Mexican pizza, the musical”.

Gorbachev funded George Carlin’s stand up which led me to become a leftist in the early 90s. that moment when I couldn’t get my shirt off at @PlaylistLive 😂 @curmudgeon44039 Comfort food, cooler weather, and Trader Joe’s pumpkin spice coffee (don’t @ me, pumpkin spice haters). 🙄 “SHOCKER” … Duh, because men act like they are so overwhelmed, can’t multitask, can’t manage their time, or be emotionally supportive. For men, it’s about THEM (them as individuals). For women, it’s about US (us as an entire family). A lot of sticks in our first blue vs. gold challenge of the season! 🙌

#RestoreTheSnyderVerse I just had to delete a tweet and it was the first time I have ever wanted an edit button 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ What I was ultimately saying is that we can have a bunch of debates about whether or not people can transition races, but at the end of the day most white people will cling to the categorization of white because it benefits them. Even the ones who play in other cultures. Cancel your Labor Day plans

I might have just had one of the most meaningful It's not a conspiracy theory. It's a very central part of American history and culture. It's observable, it's recorded, it's not something I'm making up to make excuses. It's our history @DegenToonz present 🧨 https://t.co/FopN4CJEJa You've got Republican, so-called Christian nationalists talking about the birth rate of white Americans and how low they are, but it's a conspiracy theory for me to point out that white people cling to whiteness because it brings them power. And what I'm saying here is that white people usually are not going to sacrifice that in any real way. Why? Because that categorization comes with power. Most people wouldn't deliberately choose to live in a less favorable way in this society. That's why many European immigrants decided to exchange their accents, their language, their customs, and their cultures in order to move upward in society. It was survival. It cracks me up that people like you and other Twitter accounts are retweeting this as an anti-white tweet lol. My point is that white Americans cling to whiteness because it benefits them and no discourse around race is really going to change that. And that is something that is demonstrably observable by the fact that many white Americans do not have any connection to their countries of origin because their ancestors decided to put aside their cultures in order to assimilate into whiteness and thus benefit from it. It's always pretty funny to me when people describe really clear observable historical facts as a conspiracy theory. It's not a conspiracy theory to say that the categorization of white in this country has often come with power and privilege. So, @ShawnMcBreairty, with ""loves God"" in his bio, and ""being kind"" in his tweet, doxxes a young kindergarten teacher for daring to hang rainbow hearts on the wall and encouraging her class to act like family. I bet God thinks you're a real cunt, Shawn. I endorse this post. How dare Darren Aronofsky not cast a 600 lb actor. He needs to be canceled. Thank you @vulture Surprises. Honored. Totally conceited now. 
Thanks, @DumbIndustries + @MaryJoPehl !!! All my physical scars are visible during massage. I have many. They can feel the emotional pain too. 

I feel exposed. But I need to go, so I do. 

I close my eyes and pray to leave my body for awhile and then come back. To be with my girl, then return for my boys. My daily 🙏. I do things to keep from being engulfed by pain. 

Yoga. Acupuncture. Massage. Crying. 

Today, the massage therapist asked, what happened to you? Were you in a car accident? No. Bicycling accident? No. My little girl was and she died.

@WSUAlumAssoc @CougarAthFund Wembanyama to Seattle for cash. Such a controversial topic and opinion but why not open up a homeless housing/service center in a wealthy neighborhood where there’s more resources and funding. Why is it always placed in neighborhoods that are already struggling. Today a 90 year old woman pushing a walker came into my store wearing a Steve Garvey jersey over her silk blouse. I have seen my future. In my 30s, I’m healing my family trauma. I’ve decided to start by cooking family recipes that have given me anxiety &amp; made me feel like an outsider. But I’m not an a outsider. These are MY recipes. This is MY history. It’s ok if I get the sazón wrong at first. I’ll learn. Skelly’s #UCLAFirstThursdays sneak peek:

If that dialogue were to actually happen, it would lead to a revolution, don’t you think?

Spring St. DTLA https://t.co/KOEIYyvIJn My little princess is watching #LEGOStarWarsSummerVacation and I can barely handle the cuteness. 🐈🏖 https://t.co/Zr2LESFtDt Did 12mph on the tread the other day and honestly I wanna open it up more. Like I think I could do 14mph. But scared my mind that sprints like I’m still 18 doesn’t match my body that is 37. Don’t need no torn muscles. Spent the afternoon recording the mighty, iconic goddess Carla Bozulich for #Youareclearlyinperversion, the project I’ve been developing with @thorharris666 (and an epic roster of other magnificent artists, TBA soon). 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖 https://t.co/aPXvXJXYez We have a real chance to flip this district blue in November!

https://t.co/WpfdCieWMg https://t.co/k6lRs3jmB2 Can’t exactly at this point in time put my dirty mitts on the other two stubs. But I swear on a stack of Golden Road magazines that I was there for the other two… https://t.co/D0cYGOFOto I know far more about identifying old fish than I care to. 

It’s the eyes, for starters. Had a really nice convo w/ my bartender and when I got my bill I was only charged for 1 beer out of the 3 I ordered + food. When I brought it up she shrugged it off. Even if looking for a nice tip (which I left) it’s still a nice gesture🍺🍺 https://t.co/b1ex3A5lnC I believe this because folks still try it. Go in a fish market that’s not run by a Black person, as a Black person, and see what I mean… ATL on those Cali vibes 👌

Riling up a white, neoliberal base to target a woman of color activist IS anti-Asian violence and white supremacy in action.

Fuck @KoretzforLA and all these Right-wing Democrats who continue to show that they’re the enemy of working class Angelenos. Oh sure. CPAC organizer Matt Schlapp says he &amp; Laura Ingraham went “undercover” and joined the Black Lives Matter demonstration in DC on May 31, 2020. He claims dozens of police officers &amp; Secret Service agents were “seriously injured” but “you’ll never read or hear about that”. https://t.co/0v4HCtXMja That sweet pump 💪🏾 Great day so far 👌🏾 https://t.co/QcZ5jW0uHL This sounds like something @spookishmommy &amp; @SadieHartmann would say. of course homelander's a fuckin psycho. he drinks MILK.

Ngl whenever a white person used the word “exotic”, I get ready just in case I gotta get out of there quickly If you love cars so much why don’t you marry them “I think that the well-being of moms is a bellwether for the well-being of society, in general.

At least my family will now have some justice, but Bree’Anna should still be here. They both should be. @AleksLeVO egg crew represent Shame on EVERY CITY COUNCIL MEMBER — yes alllllll of them — for letting KDL vote AND letting him vote without even being in the goddamn room. What a fucking joke. #LACityCouncil #ResignKDL What gets me every time is the fact that Beyoncé really tried to stop lil’ mama and she was not having it. 😂 Everyone kept asking me if I was going to buy them all and I kept saying I dunno but….

Please look at the top comment… https://t.co/M171qlIhQv I started covering Trevor Noah’s work back in 2015. He’s a nice man. And he’s also 💯 pandering to BW. He was advised to counterbalance the fact that he mostly dates NON Black women.

Watched the evolution of his American rebranding w/ my own eyes &amp; it worked on y’all I guess? 🤷🏾‍♀️ Just got back from the joke of a city council meeting. I’m still processing the ridiculousness of it all. she put my latex teddy in the washer/dryer goddamn @LucilleCroft this whole thread is 💯

i’ve completely rejected all that noise, even when knowing i lost gigs where my anti-sexy attire was held against me 😅

male djs can wear a black tee every gig and no one says shit, yet just as u said, we’re judged constantly Fuck this guy. In 2018 He got in our face after we asked him to step out of a private section that was set for an impacted family during their Angelversary. He made a scene and called us aggressive.  He has been trying to plant himself in impacted family circles for years. Real love won't quit on you. Feyd is the nephew of the Baron who’s played by Stellan Skarsgård in Dune and this could not be a better casting choice since Austin and the Skarsgård could DEFINITELY look like they’re all related.

@YesOnALA The new Twitter Blue subscription, which gives you a blue check verification, starts Nov 7, according to internal documents seen by The NY Times.

Audi, Pfizer, General Mills suspend advertising on Twitter due to content moderation concerns. @fozberry1 @jonbernhardt @jbouie Stalkers will happily pay more than that for postage, and they have to go to the post office or FedEx store while it's open and have to appear relatively normal.

This career is awesome in so many ways but it CAN be financially chaotic. Make jpegs, start a movement, curate a community, throw a festival. Thank you @WeatheReportNFT #weatherfest was everything I hoped for. And to everyone that reported live, #rainorshine we’re here to help. https://t.co/xUEW4R3c49 Come to find out this guy has been missing for almost TWO DAYS and his family has been looking for him. It made me feel bad because no one else would help him. Like at all. It cost $0.00 to be a good person. I’m just glad he’s okay and back with his family 🖤. Bro… this guy comes to my studio today and is very distraught and speaks no English only Spanish. After a while I figure out that he is lost, his cell phone had died and other people wouldn’t help him. I let him in give him water and let him use my phone to call his people… Our campaign was honored to attend the @ycstrikeLA action today outside city hall.

RTs appreciated. https://t.co/L9A7I4rhdk Some of y'all out here at events talking about free mints, really need to discover toothpaste~ Winner!!! @JurassicKings enjoy your @boredassgoblins https://t.co/K4AAVvDumf It’d be a fun game show to see the variance in ultra progressive’s biggest gripes when they aim to shred the constitution. Is it minority states rights? Individual rights constraining the state? Free speech? The right to self protection? That our army can’t commandeer our homes? Another actor asked me “so do you love LA” and I’m a terrible liar so I said “yeah, today, I love LA!” 

Keeping me happy here is such a team effort and I’m grateful for all participants in this venture. y’all don’t understand,, I’m obsessed https://t.co/VM06FajjZN Just recorded a role on another project I’ve been a fan of all my life. Thank you @A3ArtistsAgency and a certain director I’m afraid to tag bc NDA 😂😂 So excited to reach a whole new audience with my work!!

We are trying to facilitate and take away any inhibition you might have about casting your ballot and making your voice heard. #Election2022 https://t.co/znPoQhAg1C i feel very 👴🏼 https://t.co/3qYG6Swhvh Our “Trends in Digital Transformation to Promote Transparency and Counter Disinformation” panel was a great discussion sharing what our respective legislatures are doing to ensure transparency and accountability are prioritized in government. https://t.co/Jz5816fmwz @Acyn I’m kinda cool with it… is there a petition or…? My heart is breaking all over again…those poor children…fuck man…everything I learn about Uvalde, Texas breaks me. @tombogert He has a point tho, MLS site is bias with their ratings Every Proud Boy I’ve met is either a Veteran who has served our nation, or a blue collar man’s man that uses their back and hands to help hold this country together.

Every Antifa member I’ve met is a useless, opinionated slob that contributes nothing to society. Going to print several of my nudes and sell them at the Rose Bowl Flea Market Your time is coming, Stay Patient. I haven’t fully grasped that I have 2 major production of my play next year in 2023.

Whewwww… Mainstream media can’t mention the Proud Boys without referring to them as a “far right extremist group,” and yet all references to Antifa - responsible for setting entire cities ablaze - have only been referred to as “mostly peaceful protestors.”

Make it make sense. I’m really proud to graduate this week from my dream school with summa cum laude, the 2022 Chancellor’s Service Award, and the Hillel at UCLA Netzach award for enduring leadership! @UCLA @UCLAchancellor @HillelIntl https://t.co/8BWGN2haII So fire.

I AM FINALLY FREE OF THIS JOB 😭‼️ She’s here 🥹💙 @BoysClubCrypto https://t.co/6EYJX1qau1 her whole vibe… im obsessed @Kenny16Techs They’re looking for something to be mad about re: the Heat. You seen how they talk about Bam? You could say “I bet Bam likes McDonald’s” and they’ll go “Yeah but Pascal probably finishes all his fries.” 

It usually doesn’t even make sense. SparkToro: 70% of Elon Musk’s followers on Twitter are spam, fake, or inactive. The average Twitter user has fewer than 10% fake or spam accounts. WSJ: “Musk’s prominence and interaction with other users, as well as the topics he tweets about, make him a magnet for spam.” https://t.co/ZMYhz6u2yu Let's just allow grenades to be carried everywhere. So when a mass shooter opens up you can duck behind a desk car, table, lamp post, or pew and lob one at shooter. Since dozens will die anyway. I'm totally being facetious in case you didn't catch that. The way I was in LA and didn’t see @slayyyter no big slay :( The GTA V stripper walk 😭😭 https://t.co/0COfe6aBzB Told @twitter @JoshuaBates64 was the top center prospect in America before he had his first offer.

River Cracraft played the past eight games as a core special-teams contributor. But the #49ers determined they could not have both Trenton Cannon and Cracraft among the 48 players to suit up tomorrow. @moto_kula @AllThingsDante Which makes it classist because certain groups get that lesson mroe than others. Putting the burden of closing the wage gap on uninformed people instead of paying what the position is worth is going away slowly but surely. #24 @HarvardMTennis beats #15 Pepperdine 4-3, winning the doubles point and earning wins in singles at #2, #3, and #5. Brian Shi won 76 57 64 to clinch at #3.

• Find a comfortable grip, many start with a standard 2 seam fastball grip &amp; rotate the ball from there, the one-seam grip is popular

• Feel fingers on top through release

Perry was one of the Republican lawmakers who sought a pardon from Trump for his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election. https://t.co/HY2uuzaLqT Did not expect to get as many reactions on my last tweet as it did but it just goes to show how much we need each other as a community to encourage and uplift one another.

I heard there was a fight during Sara Landry at exchange LA this past weekend. I saw a fight during her set in San Diego. Sara Landry is certified fight techno More of @KateCagle is a win for L.A. every time i fly i am forced to confront the memory of the time i accidentally dosed myself w/ acid while i was taking some pre-flight mushrooms Somewhat amusing, because anyone can read this thread and clearly see that I never said there were six PIOs in the courtroom. I said there were six total in the office and one or two in the courtroom. Be sure to get your facts straight, @LASuperiorCourt. Imagine how different the past 3 years would have been with Dr. Ladapo at the helm instead of Fauci, Birx, Walensky &amp; the rest of the #CovidGrifters? Kids wouldn't have been forced to get sh0ts, for one thing. #DoNoHarm #AbolishAB2098 #DeSantis2024 For what? I did. The court’s “public information office” is reading my tweets, but not very closely because one of them just “corrected” me to say there aren’t six PIOs in the courtroom, only two.
“Be sure to get your facts right, Meghann.”
(Even though I never said six were in the courtroom.) Pelosi didn’t get 2 Billion from Saudi or make 650 million while working in the White House. Maxx Crosby IS the defense. Oh shit the DJ police are at the gate Picking 25 players for your World Cup roster when you are allowed 26, is so gnarly.

Today I paid off my student loan, all of my credit cards, with a savings I can be proud of, and investments for the future, all thanks to a career I created by myself. It’s all because of you all, you motivate me to work harder 💜 https://t.co/asxy0bbmVS Ummm my goal this year is to take more pictures but more importantly BE IN more pictures……… Today I learned that Maila Nurmi and Darren McGavin are buried right near each other. https://t.co/NSq7Da34cA Austin Ekeler with a catch and run of 40 yards.

Respectfully and Disrespectfully, there’s no comparison. Clearly you’ve been drinking the kool-aid. Mentally, I need a booster shot Congrats to the @OhioStateFB on one hell of a battle and win. Nothing but class from the many interactions I had with your fanbase. Not the outcome I wanted but that was a damn fun game to be at. Consuming alcohol is full of downsides: 

• Escapism
• Hangovers
• Poor decision-making 
• Productivity loss 
• Health risks 
• Expense

This isn’t a case of the rival QB stealing Greg Brady’s Fillmore High playbook. The Republicans have told us that this is what they’ll do if they take Congress.  Believe them. white supremacy is so baked into our society kevin de leon wants to force his way into failing upwards so bad *New for @KnockDotLA *

We don’t have to be dense about this. I’m not sure comparing BLACK PANTHER and TLM makes *the most* sense. One is set in the *ocean* and one is set in a (fictional) African* country.

Race, culture, etc play a major part in BP. So recasting with a white cast doesn’t actually make sense. Anyone can be a princess. Advantages of being a sober founder:

Join me soon, be ready to invest, and let's plant the beet together. Restaurants and platforms do a bad job of leaving people on their own while taking all their talent to enrich themselves. beet will be doing the opposite and we will fight for each other along the way. Soon, you will see a build out on my site and opportunities to hear the pitch for beet (codename) where you can sign up, listen, and choose to invest at our pre-seed level. Creating a platform of this magnitude will be a massive undertaking and will be less software as a service and more software with a service. The intention is to pair tech with experts and people to maximize efficiency to push dreams forward. This will allow for more people to be heard and paid along with the ability for fans and supporters to buy into the peeps they're most excited about and discover new peeps along the way. We will help people position themselves to take their creations from ideas to market and beyond by helping them skip the unnecessary steps and gatekeeping associated within the industry. Will be launching a start-up soon that will shift the way content is created by chefs, cooks, and fans of cooking by giving them more control and pay with multiple revenue streams and guidance. https://t.co/Gsl45QOJKp The e-tron GT has a nasty road presence 🥵 https://t.co/LNI1lkBvi0 Damn, this koffee verse too filthy😮‍💨 Likewise!

Fat burger for the win. Whataburger and five guys don’t even belong in the conversation. https://t.co/5yc0ai5zJ2 Although they don’t call themselves a smashburger, 5 years ago they switched to the smash method. “We use to press our meat into a patty before, but now we do that on the grill.”So essentially as a smashburger, they beat out Shakeshack IMO. https://t.co/ci23S9lzAy It’s price point, and consistency is on par with In-N-out, which is often cited as the reason why In-N-Out is better. I would argue the taste and quality of Fatburger meat is even better, since they grind and prepare their meat in-house every morning, according to the staff here. https://t.co/TGRo13FvNQ Fatburger is an L.A. Burger founded here in 1947, a year before In-n-out. https://t.co/cyRN5qq65s Folks will argue about In-n-Out vs Five Guys, Shake Shack, or even Whataburger. But Fatburger always gets left out of this convo. It is highly underrated and under appreciated. Here are some facts. A thread: https://t.co/12c2xwcjJc Thanks Lauren!

WiSpa was one of the most disturbing experiences of my life and I’ve had a lot of disturbing experiences. Today was productive and focused on the shared concern of saving the children. Holy Shit, Mariners. A guy falls asleep for an hour and woah. 👀 I forgot all about this video. We were drunk for four days straight. 💀😂. I love my crew. https://t.co/YbVlYZ7XW6 Put up this poster that I got for free at the film library on campus.

The Bruins are emerging nationally and it’s hard to ignore Dorian Thompson-Robinson and Zach Charbonnet as THE premier QB/RB duo in the nation. 6-0. Since the govt has seized twitter as an intelligence subversion playground, imagine making Elon buy this place &amp; participate in the construction of our own prison. He wanted to buy it &amp; rid it of the faux profiles but many are the feds so he can’t. Congress needs to admit to war. We have two fangtastic double feats. 2night!

I get wanting magic damage from the jungle but they didn’t have a great laner like Renekton for her to play toward and she was just invisible. Playing Welcome to the Jungle as the Utah fans flee the Rose Bowl. It’s been a long, long time since we were the bullies with swagga. #GoBruins. She’s pressing charges and the mob still goes crazy. Let due process happen. The simple fact is we aren’t at the finish line yet. Do I think I she cheated? Probably. We still have to let this play out before acting like animals. You really fixed your face to say that, when there are receipts all over the Internet. I need for Black men like you to do better Cher on the Gays"

@tcduphorn 
#MondayMotivation I used to put myself out there because I care. To be honest I don’t anymore. Left my eff’s in 2021.. How am I supposed to go back to reality after this crazy ass weekend Thank you so much and for everything my lemon friends 🥺🤍🍋✨ It’s weird that Hallmark Christmas small towns are all incredibly wealthy upper crust Christmas themed towns that are ALSO supposed to be middle america 

Only one of those exists and it’s called Sierra Madre, CA Our campaign isn’t just another vote on the City Council. We intend to fight to move policy forward that leaves no one behind and moves money and resources into our communities. Help us get there by donating today at https://t.co/sprf48TAHO #CD1 #ForThePeopleofLA LA is the epicenter of the housing crisis. I will do everything I can to keep Angelenos housed &amp; ensure that if you work in LA you can live in LA

-Strengthen renter protections
-Build deeply affordable housing
-Meet housing needs of ppl facing homelessness #CD1 #ForthepeopleofLA https://t.co/T95wBnb0YD Are we surprised that the comedian that likely murdered his wife is also a gutless coward? All sweeps of houseless encampments must be paused while the Homeless Count is ongoing. If we are to get out of this crisis we need to know the true numbers and house to scale. 

We need deeply deeply affordable housing. This luxury housing has done nothing for our ppl.
#CD1 https://t.co/Ip59NxVLqT Not only is displacement dangerous while Omicron surges, but it will also lead to an undercount of the number of ppl unhoused in #CD1. It paints a false assessment of the neighborhoods that truly need tremendous amounts of resources. https://t.co/3guAMuvFkv We won’t overcome this houselessness crisis until the city both houses and builds at the rate that ppl are becoming unhoused, and the new housing built is 

*actually affordable to the residents and workers of those neighborhoods*. 

Can you afford to live in Los Angeles? #CD1 https://t.co/fJEiA7TGQv 4 days into the new year and there is already a sweep scheduled for tomorrow morning 1/4 at MacArthur Park in #CD1 https://t.co/00dcFKnmqA Last day in the city https://t.co/bEtm5utCbK wahlburgers on sunset plaza is dunzo— fuck that place!

Some television is bad because the people who write, direct &amp; act in it don’t have the first fucking idea what they’re doing. @mrbrianrowe The kind of physical acting Quan does with this role is impressive. I hope he gets nominated but also I hope he wins. The way he plays the more personal scenes with Michelle Yeoh is what you want from a supporting actor. Nobody else could have performed this role so well. every alum that’s been around the past 15-16 years watching the students rush the field. #GBO #VFL https://t.co/uhPCJZjuvm Austin Butler is so handsome it’s upsetting https://t.co/BxbuSsy880 Tennessee 52, Alabama 49.

📸: @stokes_flow https://t.co/fFhqYEahEX @bobclendenin @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy is one of the few things about our Golden state that I find truly embarrassing. A) If you want to be sneaky about your combo that is fine, but will in invite more salt.
B)weird to expect players to know every obscure combo possible
c) if your deck needs your opponent to not know how it works to win it’s not good
D) spell table amplifies this issue even more Louis has served people as a community organizer, outreach leader, and resource connector. He knows what it would take to change CA’s trajectory and has the temperament &amp; hope to bring real change. We can end homelessness so our children don’t face the same reality we do now. It seemed tragically á propos following attendance of a discussion with friend @LouisForCA which touched on California’s current lack of progress and current representational unwillingness to assure more affordable housing, when my four year old noticed an unhoused man downtown. It was an open secret that O’Farrell’s supporters would stack the room if @StonewallDemsLA didn’t endorse. It was the same thing for our race &amp; every challenger to a Dem incumbent in LA. Gatekeeping by the establishment is the norm, no matter how corrupt the incumbent is. listened to @theallinpod ep 100 and ready for the besties at @ALLIN_meetups LA!

Even the pro-Nazi western media admits that. #denazification https://t.co/oO2oZhNgK0 Unless you see someone actively taking actual REAL life steps on becoming a better person- don’t make the mistake of believing someone when they say they’ll change. They won’t. Don’t let them waste more of ur time &amp; emotional capacity. Give that compassion to yourself instead.

I’ve said it since day one 

“they don’t even have a number for how much money I’m planning to make” what happened to sexy uber drivers? thank you to all that donated! today was awesome adulthood is cashing a $100 check your grandma sent you for christmas then immediately getting a payment request for $150 from the gardener 😭😂 Alright it’s back #ChardsDailyFinds ….. bomb!!!

I’m certainly one. The number of 2nd 3rd and 4th generation people in the auto industry is stunning. My Uber driver told me that there’s noise about him potentially getting an Emmy nod for an show that doesn’t even premiere until next Spring. He said to remember his name. Such a quintessential LA experience. I hope he gets it. Started playing Horizon Forbidden West and my goodness it is stunning. Perfect game to play in my downtime for the holidays while blasting it at full volume. HYPE https://t.co/cjWEWjngEv Our gardener likes to mention in passing new projects he’d love to start on for the house, I (noncommittally!) go “hmm sounds cool,” then he shows up randomly on not-his-regular-day and starts doing them. I get billed for it later.

😂 I’d be mad about it but his taste is 🤌🏽 I always let people think whatever the fuck they think about me cause they don’t see the behind the scenes of how much magic my life be full off  that’s why my friends become so over protective over me because they see my worth just as I protect them they protect me. @tressiemcphd It’s not on accident. A friend of mine, Wonya Lucas, took over as President and CEO of Hallmark Media. The first thing she did was promote black voices. 👏👏👏

https://t.co/bByVNqdsCn https://t.co/CtnWBaRTr6 people who are younger than me don’t exist Young hoopers so athletic these days it's really crazy. If you not dunking and showing athleticism these coaches not rocking with you. Listen I don’t make the rules for the months🤷🏽‍♀️ Happy May y’all! #DefinitionPlease #AAPIHeritageMonth #APAHM #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth https://t.co/LOtosKafxl I’m sorry, but you can’t shit in someone’s bed and expect a crisis PR firm to fix that for you. I’m sad to say that I have entered my thirst after Nic Cage era 😔 Bro, Andy Biersack is a beautiful dude, that nigga facial structure perfect as hell made it on a billboard🥺 grateful for @110football and our beautiful city of Los Angeles! https://t.co/1uNCaSHYl9 why do y’all hate bi ppl soo much i’ve said it many times and i’ll keep saying it: my DMs are always open, nothing is ever permanent, and to echo the evergreen words of @wrbolen: you are never alone. ty for listening. (i’m done now) @SpeedSportLife Baffles me the the biggest selling point of a Maverick is it's extreme value &amp; great gas mileage on the Hybrid.  Why anyone would pay over sticker would defeat the purpose of why it was built. Once the market stabilizes and the buyers evaporate, these are going to sell for a song i’m sorry to get heavy and dark on the TL, but if this post reaches even one person who’s suffering, then it’s worth it to me. because its so easy to feel alone, ashamed, and overwhelmed when shit hits the fan emotionally. seven years ago i really thought i was going to die from the weight of what i was going through. i felt completely empty and hopeless. i was lucky to have amazing friends who helped me see a light at the end of a seemingly endless tunnel. it did get better—it always does. this made me want to highlight a few of the ppl on here who are out here talking about it openly (@WRBolen, @lilpoasterboi, @bigcontentguy, @sashaperigo) in case reading their accounts of their MH struggles is helpful to anyone going through it which makes me think/worry about all the people—and especially men—that haven’t given themselves permission to talk about or even fully experience their emotions because it’s not socially condoned. Did a city planner write this https://t.co/HY0PIKUqdY and THAT reminds me that even as someone with a decent amount of mental health literacy, and as a woman (the more societally “accepted” gender to openly admit to mental health struggles) i still experience a high degree of shame when discussing this kind of thing The corkscrew of @WeatherTechRcwy definitely took us on a journey of some twists and turns 👀

#IMSA / #IMSAMonterey / #HyundaiMSCC even as i type this, though, i’m embarrassed. embarrassed that i haven’t moved on, that something from nearly a decade ago has such a strong subconscious chokehold over my mental state. at first i felt relief that i had an explanation and then almost instantly felt guilt and weakness. i reached out to @WRBolen who had this to say (he really never misses): https://t.co/kFV2XXpdm6 @Trenchtoastweet @kekelastrassi Listen… sis was FEELING it you have probably heard that the body keeps score. it remembers things in a way the conscious mind doesn’t always. today i connected the dots that yesterday was the anniversary of the lowest moments of my life to date.  https://t.co/TCE984jctM Get ready What’s up VeeFam, meant for this to out earlier but got caught up at work, anyone have 2 extra galaxy frames they are not using in todays snapshot? I would love to rent those from you if so and send them right back after the snapshot.🙂 let me know, I know we’re cutting it close. i have never spoken about this but in light of mental health awareness month and the fact that i spent most of yesterday crying for seemingly no reason, i wanted to shed a little light on anniversary effect because i certainly didn’t know about it for a long time. https://t.co/YBcaDDT4vj it’s been 7 years since i had a seizure behind the wheel that left me in a coma. the concussion aftermath had me so depressed that my friends had to come physically get me out of bed. they played music with me for hours and it probably saved my life a second time…(thread) Reggie has gone Hollywood.   Great off-day hike at Griffith Park.  #labradorretriever https://t.co/NoKAd4fS14 How many have died from COVID in the weeks/months after an infection? In addition to excess deaths estimated at 1.16-1.32 million, long covid, closed small businesses, and jobs and homes lost, we keep playing with this virus instead of containing the untold damages to our people. Writers talk about how you can’t trust any writer who likes writing, but that’s bullshit. Writing is the purest joy in my life and has been since I was a kid. It’s the freest feeling I know to bring into existence something from nothing. Of course it’s hard! But it can be joyous. San Francisco is DROWNING IN LUXURY HOUSING.

Music is the language of my soul. I’m a chameleon who can channel in different dimensions, different lifetimes. It’s going to be a long ride @FrankMikeDavis1 @AmoneyResists Absolutely, everyone of these people who did something like this: tried to get fake electors put across, tried to get votes thrown out, every single one of these cheating, election stealing illegal acts should get prosecuted. No one is above the law &amp; that includes “Sen” Graham. @nbsmith77 You'd have to ask them 🤷‍♂️ We are so thrilled to welcome @gp_jls our inaugural public-scholar-in-residence @USC_GSS (funded by @MellonFdn).

2022-02-11,"last night with @GoGalaGames kicking off @GoGalaMusic 💙 https://t.co/rn1oXwn4If It’s nice that Chief Beck has gotten around to seeing what some of us saw a year ago, but the real lesson here is the  need to stop endorsing people and voting based on personal relationships as opposed to expertise, vision, and competence. https://t.co/OD4gzMoU1c i don’t understand people who hold grudges - a grudge is formed on the basis of entitlement, an insistence that you are owed something. The chili was spilled during this review 🤐👀 Couldn’t spend a sunny Friday a better way. 

Welcome to LA, @JoeCatapano_! 

We aren’t in Orleans anymore are we, @eliavgabay? https://t.co/cPlT4uBUK7 A Temple Station deputy was driving near Rosemead High School when he saw a stolen vehicle! 

After conducting a high risk felony traffic stop, the Temple Station deputy along side his partners on the ground and the air, were able to take the felony suspect into custody 

@LASDHQ https://t.co/Aho43MB6S7 I made my way out to Rams media this afternoon. Heard from Ram’s wide recievers Odell Beckham Jr. and Cooper Kupp, two key factors in the team’s offensive success.

He’s an overload clown and power drunk like all politicians and corporate oligarchs. He ain’t your friend, he acts purely out of self interest. “We can’t lose this election because of the rain.

Hes gotta little time to show it -60% Haji from all reports i gotten did not impress Gregg in last camp, hes an athletic striker who can get hot it seems, will put up alot of goals in the Turkish league but maybe came on a little late to make the WC, i still think u can find use in him tho- 40% Pefok, i dont think Berhalter rates him, at least not for his system, to me he is a player u bring in the last couple minutes to try and somehow score a goal, other than that doesnt bring much else to the team- 50% i got the 1.21 gigawatts too.. see ya soon my boys, see ya soon x 😏 
💫🕛🔙🚀 https://t.co/usmOuv902o Pepi, we thought would be a lock to go to the WC but has not scored and has gotten limited minutes at Ausburg, looking back maybe staying in MLS would have secured him a WC birth, still i believe in his talent but time is ticking on him- 50% Ferreira has gotten alot of starts under Gregg, a player who always seems to find himself in the right spots, isnt clinical enough for me but combines well with his teammates he is limited physically to play as a 9 but will continue to score in MLS- 80% Sargent to me is Berhalters ideal striker, a player who can combine well, press the opponent, and has the physical tools to compete in a WC, if he keeps scoring hes going to the WC-70% chance A 🧵 on what I believe the percentage each striker has of making the WC, Sargent, Ferreira, Pepi, Pefok, Haji, Vasquez Day 2 of jury duty over.

A lotta word vomit since this podcast ep helped me articulate a lot of what I’ve been feeling for most of my career in animation. This is why we need a #NewDeal4Animation - because we all deserve far better working conditions than we have right now. (8/8) I’ve been off work since February and I’m really nervous about starting back up in July - I feel lucky I’m going to be working under a great AD/one of my closest friends, but I’m also wondering how much longer I have it in me to keep up with this cycle. (7/8) Add in the onslaught of projects getting cancelled, and that takes our cynicism and metastasizes it. We’re vying for a shrinking number of jobs in an increasingly volatile studio climate. (6/8) If we’re failing and feel alone in that failure, we start to resent our coworkers who we perceive to be succeeding in ways we aren’t, making us feel threatened about job security - in an industry wherein job insecurity/unemployment is built into most of our careers. (5/8) Once we’re already exhausted, we start becoming harder on ourselves for not meeting a standard of work we’d like to be at, either imposed by our productions or ones we place on ourselves. This leads us to feel like we’re constantly failing at our jobs. (4/8) Looking at the big picture of the industry, budgets and schedules are getting slashed. That means more work in less time - easily leading to exhaustion. The volume of work demands far more of our mental and emotional energy than can be replenished outside of work. (3/8) 1. mental fatigue and emotional exhaustion ✅
2. depersonalization and cynicism ✅
3. lowered sense of personal accomplishment ✅

They note that different professions feel each of these differently due to the nature of their jobs. (2/8) I was just listening to a podcast citing three signs of burnout one of the leading social psychology researchers of burnout, Christina Maslach.

Reader: I don’t know anyone in the animation industry that *doesn’t* suffer from at least one or two of them.

https://t.co/PD1GrdvtnB https://t.co/YwIyzUezfJ @exavierpope It’s mental illness too. Physically attacking someone for wearing a mask or for how they look goes beyond dark, human nature. That extended isolation exacerbated people’s illnesses that were masking, ignoring it, undiagnosed or unable to pay for treatment. America has a problem.

I’ll keep protesting and carrying signs and helping w/voter registration and all of that. BUT w/o serious focused action by @POTUS that we can throw our support behind it really is just performative. #BlueVoices Saw #Elvis yesterday at a 4:15 showing. It was packed. Lots of applause at the end. Though a bit long, I really enjoyed it. Austin Butler is fantastic and made you empathize w/ EP. Should be a big box-office weekend  for it. @Cernovich @MisesCaucusCT These are great reasons that resonate with me. The videos of the emphatic celebration of what should be regarded as private and shame inducing revealed the heart of the matter and removed the sympathy I once had knowing the trauma the recipient will always carry.

Know what stories I don’t see that I’d appreciate? Men whose lives benefited from abortion. Today I honor the Indigenous warrior women, Pretty Nose (Arapaho) and Buffalo Calf Road Woman (Cheyenne) who fought alongside the men at the Battle of Little BigHorn, June 25-26, 1876. https://t.co/lMvbJsz3HG @JDCocchiarella @leatheratti Human rights are not negotiable. Woman’s rights are human rights. Lmfao this lady being racist asl to a group of Asian tourists. I sho did yell across the metro for her to shut her ass up. And Ig she wasn’t expecting someone to call her out cause bestie sure did stfu What I want is women to have economically viable paths to not sustain these kinds of self inflicted hauntings the rest of their lives. They protest because they think abortion is their first line of defense and it’s not at all a primary means of birth control. It’s traumatic. I had an abortion at 42, an accidental pregnancy. I already had two children. To think that I would not have had the choice to end that pregnancy is unfathomable. And now, to talk to my 11-year-old daughter about her body, her rights is incredibly sad, difficult, terrifying. Hey all. Just wanted to let everyone know I just tested positive for covid. I feel fine, but was hanging out with a lot of people this past week and wanted to let you all know. 😞
 
I’m truly sorry if you caught it from me and I wish everyone affected a speedy recovery. This fucking lunatic makes Trump seem completely sane in comparison. @JoshDubowAP can you tell me why you dislike @derekcarrqb so much?! All he has done is give us his blood, sweat, and tears. And after 8 szns our front office FINALLY decides to give him the tools to make a Super Bowl run. https://t.co/yaduOMQjpQ I tried to have a lil Baywatch moment but ended up less than graceful 😂 https://t.co/dExlCTQjAO If you zoom out a bit, mass protesting for removal of all inconveniences for ending life looks like collective unresolved trauma display. I don’t think you’re going to hell. Trauma is an invitation to not persist in the same behavioral trap that created the wound on parade. Heal! Nobody’s saying that voting doesn’t help, we’re saying that if the people we vote for are just gonna tell us to vote without ever DOING ANYTHING, then what is even the point?

Gotta thank my hubby @glitczh for getting me into NFTs and Web3. Joined this wicked group of people for my first collection. Can I get a woot woot! @wickedcraniums https://t.co/mJ2njtpxzG In my experience government can work very effectively in situations like this. The public needs to see us get Monkeypox in hand and the fast action, competence &amp; caring necessary to get us there is all within our power. /end There is a lot of real work involved in preventing monkeypox from becoming endemic: buying vaccines, empowering labs, pushing CDC &amp; FDA to move faster, listening &amp; responding to community needs as they emerge, anticipating challenges.

Every obstacle can &amp; must be overcome. 14/ There is an excellent discussion on all of this from @reluctantlyjoe and @DrJayVarma on the current situation, the shortcomings &amp; the solutions needed.

Thankfully the Administration has provided an open line to experts like them. They must keep an open line to the community.13/ 5. The final point— communicating clearly and directly with the public. Straight talk.

When will things be done.
What is the clearest public health advice.
Hotlines.
How we are doing against are commitments.
Reporting on the results. 12/ We then need to collect the testing and infection data from all the states — taking whatever authority is needed— and report publicly. 11/ 4. Once we can make a commitment for how long it will take to vaccinate high risk ppl, we can be clear for how long NPIs to reduce transmission would be needed.

We can better expect people to make lifestyle changes if they know how long they will be needed. It’s not forever.10/ Set up a one stop shop to get immediate access to therapies and make it clear to physicians that they should not let their patients suffer.

At the same time, expedite an EUA using the NIH study. Aim for weeks not months. 9/ 3. From anecdotal reports, therapies work quite well l— but are still too hard to access. Too many people are in too much pain.

The complexity is that the therapy is approved for small pox so we need guidance &amp; a much easier off label process.8/ Scientists tell me at home tests can be developed here as monkeypox can be detectable on the gum line &amp; other places.

FDA should publish what is needed for EUA &amp; the slew of at home COVID test manufacturers will jump on it. 7/ Now that we have commercial labs beginning to produce PCR tests at scale, those tests need aggressive distribution.

Many of the symptoms do not present as monkeypox, so tests should be available in places beyond doctor’s offices in communities. 6/ 2. Once we tell people when we can have this contained, can we lay out a multi-pronged strategy for managing monkeypox in the meantime.

That begins with testing. 5/ The vaccine doses need to be distributed to high priority jurisdictions regardless of the requests from those jurisdictions.

In other words, set up vaccine clinics in Miami &amp; Houston whether the states ask for them or not. We know where the populations at risk are. 4/ From what I understand, we should have enough doses to vaccinate over a million people in the next several weeks with their first dose. 

We need to lay out that timetable &amp; the timetable for vaccinating the hundreds of thousands of additional at risk people &amp; for second doses.3/ 1. The end game is to quickly vaccinate high risk groups as quickly and urgently as possible.

We have no hope of containing this until that is done. 2/ Damn forgot that Diamante was such a savage she needs to be in the #Tbs title scene #AEW https://t.co/4sO64bI2lO With this beautiful inside out human being ❤️❤️@ParinHeidari at

Tyreek says his kid is a huge fan of “Big Fish.” @fukinwally Go to the show for whichever band has a member personally respond to your question. 😂🤘🏽 We all have bad games. My message to Tua is they’ll forget about a tough game if you go out and throw for 6 touchdowns next time. You can’t be great and dwell on the past. - Tyreek Hill https://t.co/CF9oEN22H5 Tua Tagovailoa is very relaxed and comfortable in this outdoor press conference. Tua has been particularly good the last 4 or so press conferences. It’s evident he’s really trying to engage the media and expand on the answers. Cool to see. https://t.co/hvJBFwMYim @KenJennings @Jeopardy That definition of ""rake"" is kept alive by crossword constructors who apparently think yardwork-based clues are beneath then On his ankle, Tua Tagovailoa said: “At this point in the season, it’s as good as it’s going to get.” @EDMeadArt Writing is so vulnerable!! Tua Tagovailoa, asked about Eric Fisher, quips, “Who? The point guard for the Lakers (Derek Fisher)?” as he put his left hand up in a shooting motion. Missed connections &amp; incorrect paperwork meant travelling for 3 whole days instead of 18 hours. Almost sobbed with relief when I finally landed in LA.

But his Dad preferred Alabama and he’s glad how it worked out because of where he’s made it. Tua Tagovailoa, on the UCLA campus, says he once thought he was going to go to USC and it was even once his dream. But his father wanted him to go to Alabama.

Bryan: The Right continues to peddle election falsehoods, defend armed insurrection, pass restrictive voting laws, blame Jews for rigging elections and have even co-opted Betty White’s death to tar vaccines.

Congrats Champ‼️ lmfaooo Thinking about how I was at a pizza birthday party with Luna and one of the kids hates pizza and was quietly eating bean and cheese burritos from Taco Bell that were in her moms purse because it’s one of the only things she likes. Loved her Every month I marvel at how gross it is to have a period. I know some ppl are into it but ehhh. I’m. Not.

Kevin McCarthy &amp; many of others could have made the same choice. In honor of Latino Heritage Month, Rafael Belmar Osuna had the chance to speak about his experiences on the team during the 1983-85 seasons. 

He also shared about his uncle, Rafael Osuna who was the first Mexican world champion in doubles at Wimbledon (1960). https://t.co/DKvrOcWcz7 Nancy Pelosi is extraordinary.

Let’s more than hope for a better season. Let’s help minimize it. /end No matter what happens. A few things we won’t regret. 
-Getting the bivalent booster (data looks good, uptake looks bad)
-Consider getting kids (as young as 5 now) boosted esp. if they’re going to be near grandparents
-Using Paxlovid if you get sick
-Masking more during waves 13/ 2022 could be the first year of one Greek letter dominating the entire year @dr_kkjetelina tells me. (She’s on @inthebubblepod Monday.) 12/ What’s the other 20%? 

It’s scientists giving themselves room that there’s something we aren’t seeing with our current, weakened global surveillance &amp; genetic testing.

That a more troublesome new Greek letter is out there somewhere mutating. 11/ And if we do have ladder-progression, small incremental variants and many of them co-circulating, it could represent what an endemic state could be like.

Experts I have talked to rate a scenario like this at 80% or so likelihood. 10/ Once concern is with each variant we need to ask how our stable of drugs and vaccines hold up. And at least against one of the variants (BA.4.6 if you’re keeping score), Evushield doesn’t appear to hold up. 

Against others the monoclonals don’t do as well. 9/ If this is what indeed happens— multiple marginal variables— it could feel quite manageable if people avail themselves of boosters, Paxlovid if they get ill &amp; are at risk &amp; Evushield* if they are immune compromised. (*see next tweet) 8/ And there is a high likelihood, even with light or modest changes in variants, that there will be an uptick in respiratory diseases like COVID. And coinciding with the flu. 7/ The rise in cases in Europe don’t appear to be variant-related but seasonal.

Here in the US, cases are still dropping but plateauing in some places. Wastewater is telling us we may be on the verge of seeing cases begin to rise in the Northeast. 6/"

The toll that all of this has taken has been beyond anything I could’ve imagined, &amp; I’m sorry to many for how distant &amp; hard to reach I’ve been… The heartbreak continued when we had to say our goodbyes to the absolutely amazing little Pepe (lil Pepsters), the other sweet kitty of the house of LaMarche… (he was my favorite, but he was certainly his momma’s boy) https://t.co/8QI8ljPP6Z Proud of you @CJWallaceSJB Then, very suddenly, cancer also befell &amp; took from us one of the LaMarche family dogs, Lawrence, the beautiful &amp; formidable white German Shepherd… https://t.co/lW8rtjtlkn The next day my family lost our dog, Kira, to cancer. I was unable to be back in Florida to say my goodbyes, because I was with Jonathan for Mew, but I made sure that my family gave the good girl extra love for me… https://t.co/tKDTWKAeEv Right at the very beginning of the year, Jonathan had to say goodbye to his little best friend of almost 19 years, the incomparable, cuddly &amp; always the star of the show, Mew… https://t.co/O2ZXZiJ29M We lost Precious back in 2020, and she loved Samwise, so I like to think she was very excited to see him.

@0x_ara Friggin autocorrect “I could do your job. You could never do my job. Just remember that.”

Izzy saying he can do (our) job because he has a YouTube channel is like me saying I can do his job because I hit a heavy bag five days a week.

Both are claims are dumb. 🙄 Ascension of Awareness, Christ Consciousness, The Buddha Nature, whatever attempt feeble language merely dances around- it is not heavy, but weightless. It empties. It unblocks. It liberates. It is culture, it is society that is the fettering ball &amp; chain weighting down humanity. The Supreme Court makes our country a more dangerous &amp; deadly place, while they demand law enforcement authorities shoo peacefully protesters from their neighborhoods.

@Lions We’ve arrived at the point where white conservatives very clearly believe anything that doesn’t actively kill people, strip away their rights or destroy the world is ”woke” Of course Ron DeSantis thinks any concern over monkeypox is overblown. DeSantis: “I am so sick of politicians, and we saw this with COVID, trying to sow fear into the population. We’re not doing fear.” DeSantis obviously doesn’t know any gay men. The fear is real. Never doing fwb again. Commit or choke 📢ATTENTION RESIDENTS📢: tell the med-student on your team they are killing it, in front of your attending.

A friend asked me a similar question last week. My answer: We’re already here. You’re already here. This is YOUR time. OUR time. 

I’m glad you’re here. Today is a sad day in LA. Racist comments (and slurs directed at gay council members) by city leaders are unacceptable and abhorrent and heighten divisions rather than bring our communities together. (Continued). “What do you mean Title Fight tickets are sold out?” The D.O.C. spoke to the Cowboys last night. Gave them an inspirational message pregame message, per Mike McCarthy

Humbled to have had the time to sit down with @ChrisVanVliet and talk comedy, wrestling, and how Back to the Future is the most perfect movie of all time. Don’t @ me Just wanted to follow up: You’re right to highlight the performances. None of this works without the heart, the emotion that Jim brought out from all the actors. Watching them during filming was raw theatre. There should be more noise about this. Not all wrestlers can be comedians.. but all comedians should not be wrestlers. 

@RonFunches is the only exception I will hear of this. @ACatWithNews @kdeleon is a racist who surrounds himself with racists.

This is who KDL is. It seeps into everything he does from appointments like Jose Gutierrez, to policies like 41.18, to physical violence on those who hold him accountable.

KDL must go. @emschumacher Sometimes I find it hard to hold back. The lady was badgering the other one “in the name of Jesus” and just nope.

Pensive inclues Coffee Shoppe, Library Scriptorium, and Stonemoss Chapel. https://t.co/sXYdFPH3Kc 1 like and i go buy boba Did this tiny backcourt hurt in the last game? No. Do I get it? Also, no. AK 📗 In STEALTH, your party has been hired to perform a heist at a well-guarded cathedral. The payout potential is huge, but so is the risk. It's perfect for players who enjoy a bit of intrigue and sleight of hand. Stealth includes Den of Thieves, Dungeon Depths, and Sanctuary. https://t.co/oJWV57wsmS When I saw this in theater, I was seated next to a woman who was sighing heavily and frequently, because she was on what appeared to be a date with a grown man who squawked when he laughed.

Not about the leaving, but the “what now?” A dude 37 years old has no business winning an NBA scoring title, he shouldn’t even be top 25 in scoring like what is happening here? Just hit up the #3 @jpegprty and I have to say it was a blast. Thanks @kingFlash_420 for the invite. https://t.co/mSlmom0vto !!!! @SimuLiu !!!!
I am honored you’re in his dms, i’ve already picked out our wedding song even though he does not like me If I had a nickel for every Oscar I won…

Thank you sir for always taking the time to talk over the years. https://t.co/JelIWAQxsf I don’t care about the Oscars because I don’t care what soggy old white men think is a good film. It’s the former. They seemed to genuinely think they’d be able to save the winners for the show, so they weren’t going to tweet them until the speeches were edited into the broadcast. It never made any sense. Absolute savagery. I need water Here's hoping for super powers, and not just cancer

Which, for Jim Morrison, sounded entirely plausible. This is stupid and confusing. IMO, the old Twitter blue was fine the way it was. Pay money for additional features, makes sense. Why add the stupid checkmark? It serves no purpose other than to be confusing. So I’ve now seen two different kinds of checkmarks on Twitter, white and blue. The white ones seem to be people who were verified pre-Tofu Takeover, but the blue ones it seems can be either actual verification (a notable person) or Twitter blue purchased verification??

@INXS https://t.co/kz2RJNqSuW Eight years is both a long time and a wink of an eye, depending upon your perspective. For a kid of 12, I suspect it feels like forever. America has had a lot of time to change to save more kids like Tamir, and we haven’t done it. I wonder whether he would be disappointed in us. Bring home Kramoda for thanksgiving. Your family will be too busy sipping to ask those uncomfortable questions. ☕️🤫 Ball game #opendorse https://t.co/hbXldV4bKz I went to the site of the shooting weeks later. Cleveland’s winter had frozen the police car’s tire tracks into the mud. As much as has happened these last eight years, though, at least one thing hasn’t: cops can still do what they did to Tamir and expect impunity. @nymike100 @amicsta You think Monroe isn’t great??

Pretty fucking great to me!! https://t.co/Tm6yCnwxys @kneerecon @joncoopertweets Actually, race IS a factor here.

Happy Tuesday! As a lead-up to (USA) Thanksgiving, I wanted to thank a few folks each day who made my life better from knowing them. Monday, I thanked a few individuals. Today I thank @dungeoncraft, whose YouTube videos finally inspired me to start a D&amp;D campaign for my daughter. i forgot about this ABSOLUTE BANGER The trick, as I just wrote this week, is to envision us black folks as something mightier than we are in order to validate or excuse what is then done to us. It isn’t a compliment. It is a justification.

Now I’m with four reps (two managers, two agents) and each have taken to different scripts. It’s so refreshing!! One thing I’ll add to this (especially if you’re looking for reps!) is to reiterate how important it is to have reps who respond to material. The pilot that got me staffed? 1st rep said “I don’t understand it.” Pilot that got me the latest meeting?

Is there any other way to charitably understand Dr. Mohler saying anything else? 

I…I don’t really know what to say. 2016 Mohler &amp; so many others I respected said this wasn’t the case.

The argument here seems to be that being transgender somehow makes you more predisposed to violent sex crime which is really only a belief you have if you're honing in on someone's transness. I'm pretty sure nobody argues that being transgender means you can't be a criminal I think this is the striker you should be focused on bud https://t.co/HeuwNkydEP So to me it's confusing that the same logic isn't applied to the majority who are demonstrably more likely to actually exert these crimes and get away with it. Why not apply a similar logic to a more dangerous group? Why don't we do that? There are demonstrably far more cis white men in prison for these crimes than trans women collectively. If this is the complete sum of all trans women who have committed violent sexual crimes, that's an incredibly small percentage of a pretty small minority Im also really fascinated by this logic because if we  follow it to its complete conclusion,we should all be overwhelmingly limiting the rights and access of cis white men who overwhelmingly statistically are more likely to exert violence against women and girls at larger numbers Sitting next to @itsmarkmoran for the next 6 hrs ama https://t.co/oYnklWmvd8 Been In the studio locked in every night for the past week and let me just say..

💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 https://t.co/SH9JC7dsp0 You could say both of these things are threats and I don't disagree with you, I'm just curious if you think these two things are exactly the same. Do you genuinely think that there's not a difference between these two things?
If, for example someone said ""kill the libs"", do you really think that that is the exact same as someone threatening to bomb the White House? believe all music fan clubs will eventually be on chain. the ability to drive a tighter relationship between artists &amp; fan by way of NFTs is massive. @medallionfm leading the way—

now @jungle4eva: https://t.co/hRffENM8Rq

guess who’s next? I don't think you're capable of connecting the dots really. Obviously I understand that saying kill the terfs is offensive and I wouldn't say it personally. I'm confused by why you're conflating that with threatening to bomb a specific location full of sick children? To me it's kind of fascinating the degree of violence that can be exerted against trans folks and that seen as reasonable and understandable by some and then when a trans person who exists within said violence says fuck you that's akin to terrorism. meetup vibes 🎉❤️🌊 @irl_alpha @patrickamadon @beginbotbot https://t.co/MGbruQdAHs Who's ready?? 🙌⚡️💛💙 Let's go!! https://t.co/Kh7gpdxyNH I don't know if I'm fully comfortable with the idea of limiting people's rights because people within that certain group have committed crimes or said strange things on Twitter. Interesting how that's never used as a precedent against limiting the freedoms of white men. And I'm curious if this is evidence of terrorism, why wouldn't you use the actual violence against trans folks as evidence in a similar way? Is calling someone a cunt the same as threatening to bomb a children's hospital? So your evidence is people wearing t-shirts and trans women who are convicted of violent crimes? How exactly is that similar to bomb threats? I'd appreciate an explanation of that.

We should’ve funded:
Housing Assistance
Jobs
Mental Health care Fuguring out the costs of those externalities (and thus the fees) will require careful study. Too high, and you have a de facto maximum that results in desirable spaces not being built. (And you generate no revenue.) Too low, and your community is slammed with excess parking.

@rainbowbarandgrill https://t.co/WmK3cyt0Mm One of the missiles from Russia used to kill civilians had ""For the children"" painted on the side of it.
That same missile killed 5 kids. 🤨🧐🤬🤬🤬 #StopPutinNOW (And as a happy side effect, it creates a new stream of revenue that can be used to mitigate those externalities.) A simple per-space fee that increases with the number of spaces is the best of both worlds: it forces developers to internalize the costs of their decisions, while still giving them the option to build parking where its benefits truly outweigh those externalities. Just filthy 😳 https://t.co/1EF8CyqJxN They also ignore what I take to be a deeper critique by Shoup, which is that planners cannot divine the optimal number of parking spaces for any given development. Maximums are certainly less destructive when wrong, but if we appreciate that deeper critique, we should be humble. @TimSevenhuysen @karonmoser Tim doesn't know the meme :( Loving the new FANTASTIC BEASTS trailer now playing that spends the first half showing old HARRY POTTER footage desperately trying to sell this film 😂 @myglyvr Not me thinking that was actually Tae I actually buy the argument that off-street spaces have externalities in that they encourage vehicular traffic. But parking maximums that aren't zero (a problem for conceptual reasons) strangely imply that these externalities don't exist below some threshold. Should I host a sub tourney? And the winning team will get $$ and the person with the most kills gets a designed pair of keeks/ your gamer tag adidas shoes? Lmk!! Heading back to the cold and frigid Massachusetts.

KDL and his staff are becoming unhinged because they are feeling the pressure of The People.

He makes these absurd claims because he can’t refute the criticism of his policies that’ve ALWAYS harmed much more than they help https://t.co/SVhHsj6zUv Over just 7 days @kdeleon
- insulted our connection of his sweeps to our history of EO9066 state violence
- swept Toriumi Plaza w/ LAPD *twice*

But we must tether ourselves to that which gives us strength and hope. Homeowmers who want to restrict their neighbors' property rights have mechanisms: purchase them, sign deed restrictions, etc. No reason for the state to unilaterally transfer such rights in pursuit of segregationist/aesthetic/lifestyle preferences. https://t.co/p94Et8brQr ""Like a butterfly leaving behind its Earth-bound caterpillar shape, a new, larger and more beautiful observatory transformed over the course of a weeks-long journey in space."" - @Dr_ThomasZ on @NASAWebb https://t.co/ttSlUnhqEI via @SPACEdotcom @CalltoActivism Clarence Thomas will chop off the hand that fed him. 

Sad and quite ironic! Audition snaps today #print #mom https://t.co/9tK4hq9MrZ This has silly implications: imagine you have a state-enforced cartel in an industry, with regs blocking entrants.

But hundreds of thousands of people wouldn't have died if the whole country had adopted masks and vaccines as thoroughly as, for example, my city in California did. My prediction:

KSI with better stamina, will take the win over Dillon towards the later rounds.

Don’t count Dillon out. However something tells me we gonna see a lot of clinching. I really hope it isn’t a “frustrating” fight.

We’re building together, not divided 🤞🏾 I be bustin my own lips with these big ass dentures 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️ It is not going to mess up your hormones. Stop telling women that lifting is unsafe or bad for their health. It is simply untrue. Unless you’re using steroids or other PEDs, your hormones will be perfectly fine, I promise. Stop spreading misinformation, women don’t just become roided-out rage beasts just because they picked up a dumbbell that weighed more than 5lbs. If anything, lifting improves your mood and makes you a happier/more pleasant person! a guy today was telling a woman that lifting weights would change her disposition and make her “aggro” instead of sweet so I’d like to remind everyone that no, that doesn’t happen just from lifting, and also I love kittens and the color pink and cry at Disney movies https://t.co/O92436YeNW Chilling with my new friends @coryvanlew and @andrevanlew

The radio edit is so corny and dated but the video edit is perfection I can sum up LA in this one description. One side of Sunset Blvd is at an ABSOLUTE standstill in WeHo because a YouTuber who I thought was cancelled, Dave Dobrik, has opened a Chicago-style pizza joint called DOUGHBRIK (🙄) and the influencer world has LOST their mind.

Reunited https://t.co/SRK112GLZN The NFL is going to look bad at anything less than a full-season suspension for Deshaun Watson. It’ll be interesting to see what Goodell does if the ban comes down at 4-8 games, which is being reported and seems pretty light. Look what MLB did with Trevor Bauer. Hence why the most frequent threat from tropical cyclones isn’t their hurricane force winds or storm surge like the Gulf States, but for their remnants to bring dry t-storms up the coast during the dry season. Something Bay Area residents are all too familiar with after 2020. 🌩 Gave the legendary @SylviaFowles her flowers and donated two bikes in her name tonight! Thank you Syl💐

I know the feeling dude!!! daniel explaining the leftovers to kyle's face and not including him with them why is this the funniest thing ever #bb24 @Kathryn32595204 Yes, Mexico will pay for it. I saw Spike Lee on the lot once and he was so cool and charmingly intimidating and dressed in the wildest fit you’ve ever seen with the dopest sneakers and all I could do was kinda lower my head and say “Mr. Lee.” under my breath. I got a nod back. Felt blessed by the film gods. Fucked around and HE caught ME https://t.co/3CVzcK4O8F @LOluwafunminiyi @Guslivesagain Yes, the character that essentially started the modern genre is the worst ever.

It is clear that the team behind it loves documentary film making but more importantly cared about capturing our space in a meaningful way. The show really is a love letter for League of Legends esports. Finally got around to watching the #PlayersTheSeries season finale and I… honestly have so many thoughts.

In a country where domestic abuse protections were rolled back in 2017 women are incredibly vulnerable. War will exacerbate these issues. Yes, you can tell by looking at my body how much I’m influenced by Jocko. 😑😑😑

I know she can kill it having a real one by your side is just something money can’t buy If the United States was a transparent DAO on a decentralized ledger, with each citizen having an NFT fingerprint (for voting on proposals), it would be a fascinating experiment.

It'd surely be a better experiment than the crony-capitalism which governs much of the world today. The attempted erasure of Native people from history curriculums (there was never that much to begin with) in K-12 public schools, is simply something I cannot allow to happen. Nope, not ever — not on my watch.

There has to be a better way. Also, this isn’t a good look for whatever VC firm takes this approach. Just got TKO’d by a box of gourmet donuts. And for those of you who were wondering, who was holding this offense back…well you got your answer today. Nathaniel Hackett.

That said, does that absolve Russell Wilson from any blame? No but Nathaniel Hackett shoulders the brunt of it in my opinion. Today is day 4 with no talking- in an attempt to repair my vocal cords. This no-talking business has been a very interesting experience. I been doing a lot of introspection. “Yeah I got to meet them. I’m a fan, and I’ve been for a while.

Comedy club 😂 While hiding from Raven &amp; the CIA (blonde era begins!), Moira sees a presentation by tech giant Arnab Chakladar, who is developing *human* technology not unlike Cerebro and Krakoan resurrection. He is on the precipice of creating homo novissima as described in HoXPoX. #xspoilers https://t.co/WaOycWbiDH As a parent of a pre-teen, I’m less concerned about hook up culture and more concerned about hook it up culture. Hook up culture celebrates connectionless relations while hook it up culture celebrates risking your job at McDonalds to hook up your neighbor with some extra fries. PROD SQUAD has LANDED! https://t.co/EcoNsXrPWm Moira blames C&amp;E for failing to protect her. Then she coughs. It’s important that the cancer, so far as Moira can tell, is new — she hasn’t had symptoms until now. Per Jane Foster, it has already progressed to stage four. #xspoilers https://t.co/e4WPT3Ye1m Best non-Disney hotel to stay at walking distance to the park entrance and why @BonGucci don’t call yourself a Ye stan and then disrespect X like this.

If you text me between the hours of 11 PM and 8 AM and it’s not an emergency you’re rude! What is Doug up to? Pure speculation, but my current theory is he has a plan not unlike Moira’s —  but one that doesn’t require mutants to forsake mutantdom. He’s slowly building a mutant Dominion using Warlock — a mutant Technarch cut off from the hive. #xspoilers When they move to kill her, Doug interrupts. In this issue we have learned that Doug and Warlock are doing even more Weird Phalanx Stuff with the island than we knew about. Doug is able to convince them to free Moira — at least for now. #xspoilers https://t.co/k60F1FvJ7V I’m a Black revolutionary, not a white far left activist @Justin_G0rd0n

🖤 Irene, now aware of Life III and extrapolating Moira kept her dead in order to pursue the cure in Life X, kidnaps Moira. She and Raven insult her pretensions of godhood and cut out the tracker to hide her from Charles and Erik — whom they trick intro attacking Orchis. #xspoilers https://t.co/pvemslRrwp Congratulations to our @EdgewoodBBB team for making it to the semi finals!

Thank you students and families for coming out to support our players❤️. https://t.co/MpREnWOy3U I’m so deep in the NFT game I just called a restaurant and asked them for WL instead of a reservation 😂 What has changed? Karima creating Orchis and accelerating the machine timeline, which compelled Moira to believe Life X was in a failure state. She *then* began pursuing the cure plan, necessitating keeping Irene dead. She believed Charles and Erik had fucked it up. #xspoilers I reactivated my TikTok account so I could do these dumbass audios. Sksks Finding I need to schedule time to “prepare myself to work on novel revisions” and then also add the time to actually work on novel revisions. #amwriting https://t.co/Fmx2OaHUDu Here’s the critical moment in terms of “was Moira against us all along”, I think: Karima tells us that the mutants of Krakoa destroyed the Dominions and ended the Phalanx forever. In timeline 10a, Moira facilitated that. She remained loyal to her original Life X plan. #xspoilers https://t.co/00qVZx3p9b What a wild way to see out my last week at the #genesisinvitational at Riv. 90 degrees then hail. Couldn’t be more grateful for my time here and the mentorship. Looking forward to my next adventure joining @CalClimbingSoup at Cal Club. https://t.co/elzUzOTDWH Emma immediately flips on them and goes to Raven and Irene. Crucially, we then learn that Charles, Erik, and Moira lied to her, saying “we always win” rather than lose — and she didn’t buy any of it. #xspoilers https://t.co/AN6vlPTLKV We’re having a great talk about fascism, reproductive rights, transkids, THE WICKER MAN, MIDSOMMAR, music, psychology, Hot Topic… in short, we’re having a wonderful time. Emma plays it cool, but immediately sees through Moira’s bullshit in a way that Charles and Erik don’t. Because Emma IS a pragmatist, Moira does now believe Emma will help them. #xspoilers https://t.co/AGGhwWo70L When Raven brings Irene back, and Emma votes to seat her on the QC, Moira is driven to violent rage. C&amp;E convince her they need to bring Emma into their circle. Erik makes it clear to Moira he will never pragmatically sacrifice Krakoa (or mutation). #xspoilers https://t.co/c9BvAboUVw Britney suffered in silence for 13 years!

#LAGalaxy https://t.co/WMF3ESqoPl Fully disgusted with C&amp;E, Moira NOW begins implementing her back-up “long-term strategy”: resynthesize the ‘cure’, survive long enough to implement it, and make mutants and humans merge with the Phalanx. Peace. Forever.

To do this she needs Irene dead permanently. #xspoilers https://t.co/2ok3rZs4Jy Everyone getting mad at me for pointing out that Texas has cheap housing should really save their rage for the fact that California housing policies are basically forcing hundreds of thousands of people to move there.

they said to let him go and an officer cuffed him. 

Dudes only took my shoes 😂 nothing else. Figure-four leg lock around his arms/body to restrain any arm movement 

Sunk in rear naked choke around his throat Guy began to tire out and slow down, as most men would

noticing this, my killer instinct kicked in

Accelerated like a leopard and leaped 

wrapped my arm around his neck and slammed him to the sand his other hand was checking his pocket. I figured he had my gopro/phone in there, sorta concerned he had a knife in pocket Dude had my shoes in one hand

I dig my shoes, they’re great kicks. @_Ryan_Griggs has worn them, he can confirm - a solid pair. 

I wasn’t about to let this fucker steal em. Running across the loose sand, gaining ground, heart bumping, adrenaline pumping he took off running and had about 30-40 yards on me as i breached land was swimming in Ocean

#NFTs #nftcreator #NFTart #cryptocom https://t.co/cpICQSVlJk @scrit_ anthony fantanto really ruined these kids man😭 @pygmalionundone I tweeted, but like a Viking👊🏽 Do you think that if this taxi had hit a cop, the driver wouldn’t be in jail? The problem isn’t that this case can’t be solved. The Hardy Boys could solve it within the covers of one book. It’s that the 108th doesn’t care about it. The TLC can identify all the taxis shown on GPS within a few blocks of here at this time, and knows who was driving them. At maximum, 10 of those will match make and model and have medallion numbers matching the blurry number in the image. (More likely, one or two.) Any Law &amp; Order writer can describe the one hour of elementary police work necessary to identify roughly ten (10) suspects, one of whom definitely committed this vehicular assault. I guess the 108th is too busy sitting in their cars outside Duane Reade? https://t.co/OazGAccGSa OMG!!!

All I gather from observation is the left wanting free speech to be limited by popular belief and always on the chopping block, and of course they want to eliminate #2A How are you going to positively impact the world? @2XLukesive @KwesiCapo @bosssygirll @_missjadie @KenyaJenii @Loski007 Look at this fool 😂 there’s a difference between poking fun but he damn near called me an illiterate &amp; now he’s in my DM’s. At least that’s just how I comprehended it. Dummy https://t.co/SUagxWirDE @milespphoto Hey now! https://t.co/POFUxtB34w Manchin and Collins, don’t just express “disappointment.” End the filibuster and codify Roe. If you’re that disappointed, it’s the least you can do. I never imagined ever being able to afford a $100k vehicle but hard work pays off. 

I also never imagined going to purchase a &gt;$100k vehicle and be treated worse than the DMV. 

Lordy, @elonmusk…I don’t think you have an understanding of what a 💩 show it is at Tesla in L.A. Congrats to Jose Vargas on his promotion to the rank of Lieutenan! Lieutenant Vargas is a longtime member of the Irwindale Police Department and we are happy to congratulate him on his new rank. Feel free to contact him at 626-430-2241 or by email at￼￼ jvargas@irwindaleca.gov https://t.co/OSBib9nJDF I’m proud to be a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics…thank you, @AmerAcadPeds &amp; @AAPPres for putting out this statement while so many are struggling with the implications of today’s court decision.

#RoeVsWade #AbortionIsHealthcare #Pediatrics #WomensRights https://t.co/aPLATZQmk7 America, you have gravely disappointed me. If anyone reading this is happy about todays Supreme Court ruling please unfollow me now. It’s time to codify Roe and preclude a National Abortion Ban.  It is literally now or never. Most federal mandates &amp; executive orders are abuses of top down controls. If you don’t think so, you might just be authoritarian. Don’t be shy! Many in the freest nation on earth are exhibiting authoritarian tendencies every time they FORCE people to do what they want. #liberty I thought the Supreme Court was supposed to protect us from a tyrannical minority.  Not be the tyrannical minority. The states have no authority over guns but complete authority over wombs. 

There, am I now inconsistent enough to be a Supreme Court justice? THEY DESERVE TO FEEL AS UNSAFE AS WE DO https://t.co/ve1vmujydQ I HATE WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO TALK TO ME LIKE I’M A NEW ARTIST I’VE BEEN IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY FOR MORE THAN 6 YEARS I used to be a devout Christian (was literally my mega church’s worship leader) and seeing my old community celebrate today’s decision is actually sickening. if you’re imposing your beliefs, you have no ethical mindfulness and are the reason we are going backwards. disgrace It’s not about controlling women’s bodies. It’s about aligning to the governing style of the state you choose. There’s few viable solutions for individual rights the past 2.5yrs by big gov’t. Top-down controls is a governing style of the left. Constraints have to be implemented. @Moondancer1626 SENDING YOU BIG HUGS I’m sure the GOP will be the first to slash and or deny increased funding towards welfare and foster care programs for unwanted children. After all, pro-life seems to halt after birth. Pro-life my ass. https://t.co/NMnvY2o5O9 There’s a Roe v. Wade protest happening at 5:30 at Burbank City Hall today if anybody is interested in going

I’ll be a couple hours late because of work conflicts, but I plan on showing up once that’s done Anyone interested in planning some protesters or coming up with a unified messaging plan to help get voters out to vote in the midterms. Plan to fight For all of those people who always said “I don’t vote because I don’t pay attention to politics.“ Well I need to tell you that today in America politics are now paying attention to you! Today we learned that the Church is the State.

#dnd https://t.co/0ekv0CyOZE The art of being specific about your destination but flexible about how you get there Sounds like talks between the #Dodgers and Max Muncy had been happening for a while, even before his recent uptick at the plate

Dave Roberts didn’t think it had much impact on the timing of today’s contract news. Said the club was always going to be willing to bet on Muncy One year later lol I got my One in a Million on vinyl 😍 https://t.co/VTFyDg8YMD How gorgeous is my new @hicustomland commissioned jacket 🌹🌵♥️ ily @GeegNft https://t.co/uaistEbhRN As someone who grew up with #DTLA as his backyard, I’m privileged to lead one of the premiere organizations that established downtown as a cultural hub &amp; whose mission has gifted Angelenos w/a myriad of memorable experiences. @GrandPerfs #PerformingArts https://t.co/2cVEdk7uBp Clayton Kershaw did three up and downs during his sim game today, per Dave Roberts. It was about 30 pitches

Kershaw will throw a four-inning sim game on Saturday in Miami. If all goes well, he could be activated for the next turn thru the rotation after that As physicians, we are privileged to have the chance to teach students &amp; residents what we have learned from our mentors to keep the sacred fire of knowledge alive

Thank you to all of you 🙏🏼 do i need to watch the rehearsal? bear in mind i know nothing about nathan fielder other than for whatever reason a lotta ladies i know thirst over him for reasons unbeknownst to me. Everything you want is on the other side of fear. he made a song about his Trap Queen just to hold the weight himself? Adrian Houser is here at Dodger Stadium and his scratch from Sunday’s scheduled start for the Sounds was not health-related. “Everything’s good” in his comeback from the forearm injury.

#ChromaticaBall https://t.co/BWkrFYPSx1 People that ask for specific measurements on clothing items on depop piss me off. I’m already selling this shit for dirt cheap with the tags still on. Like girl if you don’t take this size M and go 😒 This is insane! Sometime around 1997-98 my cousin Nicole (who got me into anime and many nerdy things) invited me to her house to watch a shitty VHS copy of a copy of someone watching the opening of the American Sailor moon at a con. I thought I had imagined that…until now. Seriously #film3 fam, if you haven’t seen @film_freako ’s film Elena, you have really missed something. So well deserved. BRAVO!! @ChrisBurkeShay @joanwalsh @sunraysunray @NicholsUprising He's going to run and he's going to be your president for another 6 years. Deal with it. Yes, I trust Dark Brandon to do the job for another 6 years.

If he's not able to finish his second term, the country is in great hands with our Vice President. 🏆 “FOR THE GIRLIES” is exactly what I screamed before this… 🙏🏽 https://t.co/NGHUKNiWwV This is a hugely disappointing veto by @GavinNewsom — these sites save lives and make important connections to life-affirming services. Max Muncy said his contract status hadn’t been weighing too much on him this season, but called it a relief to get the deal done now

Added that he hopes he stays a Dodger for longer than just next season, too: “There’s no place I’d rather be.” @DrVirgo1981 @FBA_BY_LINEAGE2 I am completely floored by this. I really can’t with this Bitch. 🫠
And no, I’m not seeing this damn movie. Max Muncy on his #Dodgers contract extension: “This place means everything to me and my family. There’s not anywhere else that I’d rather play. A chance to come back for another year was a no-brainer. I hope that there’s more after that, but I try not to look too far ahead.” We would be in a much better position as a City with regards to transit, if members of the LA County Metro Board actually were regular users of local public transit.

One loved the comedy and dubbed it, affectionately, a “dramedy paced like an action film.”

The other said it was a “slow burn” and wished it was “just a drama.”

Constant lesson — find the people your script speaks to. Okay, World: When was the last time you saw a Saab 900 in this rare five-door hatch form? It’s been many, many years for me.

It would cost us NOTHING to remove parking minimums and the result would have an enormous positive impact on our climate. https://t.co/xtHQJktVJA Growing up poor means having really bad quality wired headphones that you need to wiggle around to find that sweet spot otherwise you only get one side working. 49ers Home Opener Week 2 https://t.co/HxiNtGx2zM like all of these were planned months ago. luckily most of the families have been understanding cancelling all of my disneyland photoshoots this week was rough for me.

They not only loved him.

This dilution of attention is what BTC maximalists are really troubled by- when we are all divided, so will our investment, attention, and interests.

BTC tends to absorb much of it back, eventually If the @RamsNFL and especially #MathewStafford can eliminate turnovers tomorrow they win. One is too many against 49ers. Hopefully Stafford's last INT of the season was last weekend. Can't be so committed to threading ball into obvious coverage! Let's go #Rams !!! #SonyMichel “We are exploring a stablecoin; if and when we seek to move forward, we will of course, work closely with relevant regulators”

Welcome to the family man 😵🛹 

Only 8 pieces now remain : https://t.co/beDKSq1mFD https://t.co/RoVv23laGX Taking note of all the people saying mole is gross 🤨 Matt Lingo is going to Cannes @martinweiss Reminds me of that Kat Williams bit https://t.co/X1OwWzCpe7 Still in love with these, my @foundation pieces are still fun https://t.co/RmuJUYqcjR and then I see that he has blocked me.

the man contacted ME just to tell me he thought of me while he was with HIS WIFE ON THEIR HONEYMOON BLOCKED ME. 

all of this to say: he’s a Capricorn and my ass knows fucking better but here we are. 😂😂😂😂 Yesterday, the subway shooting in Brooklyn happened &amp; I know he and his family live near by and take the train daily. I send him a quick message via snapchat “Hey. are you and your family safe?” last week a gig flew me out to NYC again. in the days leading up to it I thought about reaching out. I didn’t. I knew that I’d be disrespecting his marriage and should leave the reaching out to him. so I have dinner with a friend instead and head back to LA. We talk for about 30 more minutes. reminiscing. telling each other sweet things that teetered on inappropriate but never really crossed a line. I didn’t bother to ask about his wife and he didn’t bring her up again. we hang up and I feel dizzy by the whiplash of emotions. he tells me he was just in LA. he rented a car and drove all over town. said he saw my city through my eyes &amp; thought of me the whole time. WHY DIDN’T YOU CALL?! I demanded. to which he replied “we were on our honey moon”

Oh. I say. trying not to let my voice shake or crack. a few months ago I get a message via Snapchat. it’s him responding to a selfie. I’m fucking excited. I no longer have a minimum wage job and can afford to go see him if he’d like. I tell him about being NYC &amp; he asks why I didn’t reach out. I explain I was respecting his boundary in 2019 I went to NYC for the first time on a book tour. I was there for 10 days and thought of him every day. I had my column then and wrote about missing him in it. I came back to LA, went about my life. the pandemic landed like a shit storm &amp; I was occupied with staying alive. we’d lose touch but we’d always make our way back to each other. we had the kind of intimacy you develop when all you can share is conversation. we really loved each other. it was beautiful and painful. around 2018 he disappeared on me. I figured he moved in with his newest gf. story: a guy and I fell in love over 10 yrs ago. I was catfishing him. I eventually confessed. we continued talking via Skype nightly for a couple of yrs. we couldn’t travel to each other &amp; agreed long distance ached too much. eventually we began dating other folks. wait are you sure you want me to be in charge of nukes

im not saying no to six figures in my third year of college

He's very much the fault of the wealthy capitalists who've appeased him over the years and not the fault of Russian citizens. @blakkat41 So is my whole family, genius, but when we go to a restaurant here in L.A., we have to wear masks and show our proof of vaccination. anyone else get so many spam calls they have to put their phone on dnd 😭 Saw the Afghanistan pullout thru @yamphoto’s lens &amp; felt as if I was there along side him.

Rounds responds to Trump’s lunatic attack on him &amp; adds this in his new statement about Trump’s lies: 

""Vice President Mike Pence stood his ground, acknowledged President Biden’s victory and acted with integrity. It’s time the rest of us do the same."" SPANISH TECH HOUSE 🏠 This statement by @SenatorRounds should be applauded simply because so few Republicans have any gumption to stand up to Trump’s insane non-stop lies &amp; lunacy. He is doing the inverse here of what @tedcruz did. Rounds is doubling down and expanding on what he said. Good for him.

Afternoon productivity 📉 And when your moment comes to do what you’ve always wanted to do, CRUSH IT! Before we wrote Detective Pikachu, most people in the business would not have thought us capable of writing such a thing. We had to prove and put ourselves in a position to prove it! You can too! https://t.co/T0d4wvkoix How you do this can be strategic! Write samples that bridge the gap between what you’ve done and what you want, ask your reps to look for shows that further your goals, like we did with The Tick. Suddenly, to the industry, we could write superheroes (our ability never changed!) Only you know what you are capable of writing. You might start out doing something completely different, like we did with a family sitcom, when in your heart you want to write fantasy. Execs tend to put writers in a box, so it’s up to you to challenge their idea of your writing! Every day it’s a battle.

But this book is gonna be so worth it.

We are taught to pray it doesn’t happen to us. This was actually meant to be bonus content for the GCW OnlyFans I hope they cut buddy a check! Change needs to happen We should just probably leave our flags at half mast forever since nothing changes. I legitimately have felt like throwing up since I heard the news…it’s so hard to ignore and not imagine yourself or your students in the same situation. It can happen to any of us on a campus and there’s nothing that can stop it. I can't believe the news today

@latsondheimer https://t.co/AiFFpubrzP It is really hard to want to work the rest of today. Just so tragic. The GOP is obsessed with things that aren’t real. Fetuses they imagine as babies vs mothers who are alive &amp; sentient. Thoughts &amp; prayers vs actual assault rifles. Trans people they imagine in women’s bathrooms vs actual women’s bathrooms where this has never been a problem. This week @santaanitapark kicks off my externship with @1ST_Racing.

@CarloDiLorenzo1 @deslilo @ilankoppen https://t.co/YS0ybZfwwf Today was so hard https://t.co/VMHPX0yVdd his remarks aren’t going to bring those children and their teacher back. we need action, not thoughts and prayers! “I injured ____ in highschool, otherwise I’d have went pro” is the male version of the “My mama relaxed my hair when I was little…..” story. I’m convinced. Being from Texas used to be something I was proud of. Now, I’m just embarrassed &amp; ashamed. I consider myself lucky to have been gone from there for 12 years. Vice President Kamala Harris: “Our hearts break. Our hearts keep being broken. Enough is enough.” I’ve bought some really dumb NFTs in these strange times, but I think it’s time to reintroduce some standards My heart aches for those families in Texas..  Just, ..... SMH 💔🙏🏾
 #Uvalde Thanks for the #terrortuesday! Nothing cooler than #coolworld and being Holli Would! 🔥💋 What the Republicans know is that few, if any, of their voters care enough about these dead kids to vote any different.

It’s the equivalent of making fun of gay men or women in 2022.  It’s lame.  You don’t know what our experience is like and it’s not fun to live in fear of hateful people every day. Have you ever been proud to be an American? I haven’t lmao why I’m actively trying to leave. This is the voice of reason. A voice of someone who has had to experience this loss personally.

We can’t allow that. hearing someone who holds an insomniac passport call the underground scene a ""fake rave"" was probably the funniest shit i heard today 😂 didn’t want to put this on insta, BUT also you have to be an absolutely depraved perv who can dirty talk a blue streak with me. send me sexts that make me blush and/or jaw drop and i’m all yours.

#LosAngeles l #CA
Early reports indicate there may be more than one shooter. No word on the exact number of victims, or the extent of the injuries.
More information as it becomes available. https://t.co/rVp1ISjsnE Asked the woman at the airport boarding area if anyone was using the seat next to her, with her purse on it. Her friend was coming right back, she said. Funny, no friend has materialized and her purse is still enjoying a seat in a full boarding area. My mother ran away from her boarding school three times. On her third attempt, my great grandmother hid her in the basement. My mother always slept with the light on. The darkness carried too many nightmares and insufferable memories of the horrific trauma — she had endured. I can clarity the comparison easily.

It’s thrilling just how many plethora of people have played so far… definitely one of those magic moments in time. 

What a ride… and it’s been little more than a week. It is a moral imperative that we fight the homophobic, transphobic, and anti-sex work misinformation around #MonkeyPox because it will result in real violence against our communities.

We cannot be silent. We will not repeat what happened with HIV/AIDS. https://t.co/nQvbUqnZih #MonkeyPox is not an STI, nor is it limited to Gay men.

Media outlets cannot continue this dangerous rhetoric repeating the harm from the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

What an unnecessary and ridiculous thing to be taught. I used Venmo for some talong from our Filipino farmer at the farmer’s market and used the 🍆 emoji as the memo. Then I thought, how often is that one used for actual eggplants? Death, Taxes, and Suburban parents saying “there’s nothing wrong with that!” when a 17 year old tells them they’re going to community college in the fall. Defending homeland?

Great wins last night for Northview and Monrovia.  Road wins against solid teams. @KayeSteinsapir This is true. Thank God for the 1%.

I would hope to speak with her on Kingian Nonviolence as a formal philosophy and see if she sees a central place for it in today's antiracism - and if not why. This is why King would have had sympathy for much of the grievances of the modern antiracist movement. Not enough has changed to make them irrelevant.

But King's philosophy of Nonviolence &amp; rejection of Black Power consciousness does make him different from NHJ &amp; others. 40 minute drive, Super Gremlin plays on repeat for all 40 minutes Tune in to see Kings try and prevent Meier from being just the 9th player ever to score 6+ in a NHL game.

And I’ve seen hundreds. even after two years every time a stranger rams a q-tip up my nose for a covid test it still feels like they should have brought me flowers and taken me out to dinner first Hope you’re all enjoying the post W celebration day, Bruins 😉💙💛 (credit @uclazone) https://t.co/pmNXIHwtw7 Really not here to be a full time NFT artist, I’m already an artist I don’t need sales to validate my talent, maybe I’m not cut out for “the space” but i know who i am I got the job at stiiizy that I really wanted &amp; I start Monday 🥲 yay me! I'm agnostic as to whether the University of California system should have gone full remote or full in-person this quarter, but I think we can all agree that doing an ad hoc half-remote, half-in person quarter was the worst possible option.

-people really aren't dead

-its just a bad cold
-we just gotta live with it.

#HederaNFTs #HederaHeatWave #HBARNFT https://t.co/6KwE81cKzX I don't think these people will stop being transphobic because they realize Nazis are also transphobic so I don't get this point at all. False flags are always possible but why would someone not transphobic choose to terrorize folks just so they can win an argument? Like ""sure, I dont mind when people are targeted and threatened w/ violence because of who they are or what they do. I don't mind people standing with guns in order to suggest violence is on the horizon because of who they are, but I draw the line at Nazis"" what? It takes a lot of energy and a certain degree of tolerance to hate to, as a person targeted by fascism, go and purchase hold, and wave a Nazi flag just to prove to transphobes that Nazis are on their side. I don't think transphobes get how taboo that imagery feels to most of us Anything is possible but I kinda wish more people understood that most trans folks just want to be left alone. We only loudly advocate for ourselves because we are constantly antagonized. Transphobes are overwhelmingly invested in antagonism; we'd like to be left alone. So is the theory here that a bunch of people who would be targeted by fascist policy showed up with Nazi flags to protest a Drag show so they could say ""look theyre nazis"" instead of those people just not engaging with that stuff at all?

And so policy and political programmes for social housing have to take the question of evictions as seriously, even more so imho, as questions of financing, maintenance, etc. Finally got to the registration page. “Are you interested in attending a public lecture with @Laelaps on Tuesday, November 2?”

Fuck yeah I am!! The real world implication here is that social(ised) housing should not be the abode of evictions. Evictions - the forced removal of tenants - in social housing are a political error, and we must insist that social housing get as close as possible to the eradication of evictions. Bannon won’t like prison food. 
They cook the meat 
&amp; it hasn’t turned yet. But I think we need to be explicit in this principle again and again, and therefore any policy ""reform"" that accepts any unnecessary evictions (on grounds of health and safety) that are not the choice of the tenants is immediately compromised. And we wants world without that. Apropos nothing, literally just a thought that bears repeating: the tenant power movement has to, explicitly, stand on the principle that we are fighting for a world without evictions. Full stop. It's aprinciple and how we get there and make it practicable is up for debate. these magazines just arrived 🫡 https://t.co/mqdazbyAwK Meeting Judy Heumann was the highlight of my life https://t.co/55rX6v6dZu I hate the ghoul

It's the state's job to defend society, not merely to be the victims' instrument. And how can we be certain they weren't coerced? Or for that matter bribed? Brilliant collaboration between two visionary artists @michelepetrelli x @davidcheifetz ~ Congrats on another stellar curation @XCollabz working with some of the best in the space 👏 Put in my offer 🥀🔥 https://t.co/kEz5NCyAFa https://t.co/SERVazglkK AHHHHHH IM SEEING ALL OF YOU TONIGHT AND IM SO FCKIN EXCITED 😭🤍🌟🚀 As an artist comic books continue to be a source of inspiration.

You engage in processes that sideline those with the most information to remain near your benefactors. 6/6 The irony is thick because, on the same morning, you agreed to rename the park; in closed session, you also decided to criminalize the same Angelenos General Jeff’s leadership stood for. You moved forward with a legal settlement that’s nothing short of a PR stunt. 5/6 but more importantly, we demand you stop running from your constituents and do as General Jeff did, stand tall and deliver the things that the least of thee needs most. But that type of leadership is just not in you. 4/6 time you attempt to use us as such; indigenous Skid Row leadership is fierce and non-compromising, as illustrated in the case of the two neighborhood council fights, the first led by LA CAN and the second ongoing fight led by General Jeff, Katherine McNenny, and many other’s; 3/6 The renaming of Gladys Park to General Jeff Park is more a reframing of the narrative: Black people want housing and services and will fight for them; Skid Row is a destination worthy of investment and care; we are not political toys and will rise and rebel every 2/6 At a time when leadership is abundantly absent in City Hall, it feels good to converse about and memorialize someone who represented the culture, his community, his people, and our collective interests. 1/6 9 days left!

An anthology of Latin horror legends. The eclectic residents of a small Texas town find their livelihoods disrupted in the wake of a ghastly series of attacks that seem to suggest the presence of a chupacabra. #ScreenPit #writingTV #LiteraryManagers I used to live in Lake Tahoe &amp; a buddy from the marina told me a story. 

Sometimes winds created big waves on the lake. He called a boat owner whose boat was flooded due to the storm. 

""Do you want us to try and save it?"", he asked.

""Call me back when it sinks"" the owner said.

How about more action and less awareness please? 🙏🏼 They were programs that look A+ on social media and seemingly did all the right things. But here I am, still trying to undo the harm they caused quite a few years later and I know I’m far from alone. A “HAES” program told everyone to have 2 scoops of🍦but told me to get a kiddie scoop.A HAES program made me measure+weigh every bite I consumed like I was on WW.A HAES program was where a counselor grabbed snack from my hand&amp;told me it was too much(even though i measured it 🤦🏻‍♀️). It’s honestly devastating to watch ED organizations &amp; treatment centers pretending to care about all sufferers on social media while continuing to cater to thin, white girls.

https://t.co/2bnzmEluQd I absolutely cannot stand people who adopt because they have some stupid political agenda or they want to make themselves look virtuous. This is a person who complains about virtue signaling while holding a sign that says that they are more virtuous than mothers who abort. Not to mention that this is something said with such little thought. Adoption is an expensive and long process and there are so many children who are currently in foster care.

I'm voting for as many of you as possible https://t.co/PPIFDWDUgy I got a haircut today and happened to leave my wallet at home.

I was also having issues logging into my Venmo account.

But it so happened to be that lady cutting my hair (Latina in her 50-60’s) was also into crypto and told me I could pay her in ETH.🔥

Such a dope interaction. Sorry, but so many of the attacks on Kyrsten Sinema focus on her appearance. I don’t hate her because of how she looks or dresses. I hate her because she just singlehandedly sold out democracy. Hello! https://t.co/ta6dze2PWj The filibuster or 60 vote requirement are constantly dispensed with-unless it’s something the GOP doesn’t want changed. Then it’s a violation of “Senate tradition.”

No offense, but preserving the vote is more important than tradition. As were getting rid of slavery &amp; segregation 🌅 Bruce’s Beach. #35mm #leicam7 #portra800 https://t.co/SVRDs0aKaK can audibly hear when europe falls asleep and the timeline gets quieter and more boring I’m tragically naive. I can’t fathom how any Senator, of either party, can’t be for the protection of voting rights. But a Democrat who won’t do ANYTHING to protect them? That is unconscionable. It might feel very high and mighty for Kyrsten Sinema to know that she alone can kill or pass significant legislation. But her ego is playing with fire and just might usher in the end of American democracy. Kevin McCarthy wants to lead a legislative body while simultaneously refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of that body’s investigatory committees.

There’s no call to violence, per se. But the concept of a conspiracy to take over America is there. As someone that benefited from media shifting to a more open minded space in regard to range in aesthetics, I have no impulse to criticize the appearance of other people in magazines. Buy the cover you like. That’s the way to say what you want to see. Remember they’re humans.

You might to ❤️ @elonmusk Ah yes, Democrats, the party of division and hate https://t.co/hLR4Fca77a new music from yours truly very soon and it is extremely emo vibes This conversation with @NzingaMD is on  one level the best description of what are kids are going through. On another it’s what we have all been going through.

But Nzinga’s gift is talking to us about what we can do about it. I didn’t expect to be uplifted. Faith Hill Says Filming Sexy ‘1883’ Bathtub Scene With Tim McGraw ‘Was Tough’ My guy nice with the designs, Congrats @DariusSalary well deserved!!

But now that I’m the richest person on the planet, kindness doesn’t matter so fuck healthcare, voting rights, or paid parental leave for those who need it. 

I got mine.

Truly a strange day it’s been. Just throwing this out there, every single game Austin FC has won, The Josh was head coach. 

Josh Wolff is head coach tonight against LAFC…

And he is incredibly handsome for the cherry on top. “The Body That Loves You”… Many people ask me what the main difference between writing a tv pilot and a movie is, and basically it’s an extra 70-80 pages to hate yourself. @Viggie_Smalls93 I like how during some screenings of Everything Everywhere All At Once,
he said there weren’t any roles for him (implying the market only wanting him to play stereotypes and pigeon holed roles) and it was because of Crazy Rich Asians he felt that mold break and he could return."
